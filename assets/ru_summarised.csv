0	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that Russia will conduct additional destructive or disruptive cyber attacks connected to the crisis in Ukraine. Russian cyber attacks almost certainly will focus first on Ukraine, with Western/NATO allies also being possible targets. NATO and Western sanctions and responses likely will heavily influence Russia's perception of high-priority targets for retaliation, and Russian action may be focused against the financial industry, oil and gas sector, and media and entertainment. Organizations making statements condemning Russian aggression and/or supporting Ukraine and organizations taking actions to restrict Russian participation in international commerce, competitions, and events face elevated risk of future reprisal. We assess that Sandworm and UNC2589 are two of the most likely actors to conduct cyber attacks in retaliation, although we judge that all high-profile Russian threat actors will continue or increase cyber espionage to enhance decision advantage against Ukrainian and NATO government targets.

1	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence mapped out the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of Russian threat actors APT28, APT29, Turla, Sandworm, TEMP.Armageddon, TEMP.Isotope, and TEMP.Veles to the MITRE ATT CK framework based on activity observed by FireEye devices, Mandiant Incident Response, Managed Defense, and research. Based on current observations, Turla has demonstrated the broadest portfolio of tactics, followed by APT28, and APT29. We observed Russian state-sponsored actors use many defense evasion tactics as well as command and control (C C), discovery and persistence, though this distribution is likely at least partially influenced by the overall quantity of tactics in each category.

3	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the Russian Federation directs a series of sophisticated, long-standing cyber espionage programs that conduct threat activity and information operations globally against targets of interest to the Russian state. We have lower confidence in our attribution of some named groups to specific Russian security services due to Mandiant's lack of technical evidence associating many of these actor sets to their respective organizations. However, we draw on a wide body of open-source reporting on the mission mandates of Russian intelligence services and government attributions of specific actors to link threat groups we track to their likely sponsors. Attribution is a critical component of cyber threat intelligence because it provides insight into actor intent and helps analysts characterize current activity, anticipate future threats, and provide risk assessments to inform defensive strategies and resource allocation. We assess with high confidence that Russian-sponsored cyber threat groups represent an acute threat to governments, media and civil society organizations, and industrial control systems (ICS) in Eastern and Western Europe and North America.

5	 The number of zero-days exploited as of July 2021 is on track to more than double the previous record volume from 2019 and has already surpassed all previous years on record. State-sponsored groups continue to be the primary actors exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, although the proportion of financially motivated actors deploying zero-day exploits has grown significantly since 2019. Microsoft's Exchange and Windows Server software, Apple's iOS, and Google's Chrome browser had the highest volume of zero-days exploited by threat actors, likely reflecting the popularity of these products. The vast increase in zero-day exploitation in 2021, as well as the diversification in motives and actors using them, expands the risk portfolio for organizations in nearly every industry sector and geography, particularly those that rely on these popular systems.

6	 FireEye Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the cyber espionage threat to national governments is severe. Nation-state threat actors frequently target other governments to gain access to political, diplomatic, economic, and military intelligence. We assess with moderate confidence that the information operations threat to national governments is high. Nation-states increasingly engage in information operations meant to affect government policies, influence national elections, and undermine public confidence in national institutions. FireEye Intelligence judges that hacktivism typically presents a frequent but limited impact threat to well-patched national government systems. However, prominent government websites have been successfully targeted by hacktivists in recent years. We assess with moderate confidence that financially motivated activity presents a moderate threat to well-patched national government systems as criminal actors commonly target vulnerable government databases to gain access to personally identifiable information (PII).

10	 Russia-, North Korea-, and Iran-nexus threat actors have demonstrated a willingness to conduct operations against the utilities industry in the last several years. We regularly observe indiscriminate cyber criminal campaigns impacting this sector and, albeit limited, financially motivated intrusion groups such as FIN7 have also impacted the utilities industry. Despite occasional hacktivist or disgruntled insider attacks, the current threat is low. Utilities, especially those invol v ed in electricity generation or transmission, should include geopolitical environment analyses when determining security strategies and investment priorities.

11	 FireEye Intelligence continues to observe state-sponsored and other threat actors target national elections to collect intelligence and exert influence as well as attempt to delegitimize or disrupt the electoral process. We assess with high confidence that actors will persist in targeting entities associated with elections. Based on activity observed from 2016 2019, we believe that threat actors have focused their targeting against electoral platforms affecting public opinion, such as news organizations, political parties, and other entities with comparatively larger attack surfaces than core election systems. While we have observed one credible instance of a core elections system being successfully compromised, we have not observed evidence of any instances that resulted in alteration or manipulation of votes . FireEye Intelligence anticipates that future threat scenarios could include disruptive threats such as ransomware attacks impacting electoral processes and related organizations.

12	 We assess with high confidence that Russian and Chinese espionage actors consistently pose a high-frequency, high-impact threat to U.S. entities. Future targets are likely to include entities connected to the upcoming U.S. election and entities involved in defense, diplomacy, and/or policymaking. Iran and North Korea also pose a potentially destructive threat based on current geopolitical tensions and past activity. Information operations that support Russian or Iranian interests pose a high-frequency, moderate-impact threat. We have also observed campaigns targeting the U.S. that do not appear to support state interests and at least one campaign that may have been orchestrated by a marketing firm in support of a third party that appeared to support state interests. We assess with high confidence that the U.S. will remain a high-frequency target of both targeted and opportunistic financially motivated cyber activity for the foreseeable future. Operations range from low to high impact. We assess with moderate confidence that the perceived lucrative nature of high-impact operations, such as targeted ransomware infections, may cause additional actors to adopt these tactics. We assess with moderate confidence that hacktivist groups will continue choosing U.S. targets for demonstrative cyber activity; however, most activity will not constitute a threat to security-conscious and well-resourced entities. We assess with moderate confidence that an increasing number of countries will demonstrate offensive cyber capabilities in the coming years. Based on the prominence of the cyber domain in modern economic and political competition and the growing presence of private companies offering offensive capabilities for sale, the number of U.S. cyber adversaries is liable to increase and diversify.

13	 FireEye Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that cyber espionage continues to pose an occasional, moderate-intensity threat to Turkish government and commercial sector entities. In the past two years, we observed Russia-, China-, Iran-, and North Korea-nexus groups targeting Turkey, including critical infrastructure targeting. Financially motivated threat activity in Turkey remains a persistent, moderate-intensity threat to multiple industries, most notably financial services. Observed activity includes targeted intrusions and opportunistic campaigns. Information operations by likely Iranian actors present a somewhat regular, low-intensity threat to Turkish audiences. Turkish information operations in support of international political objectives constitute an occasional and limited-intensity threat. Politically motivated hacktivists present a high-frequency, low-intensity threat to public and private sector entities in Turkey and beyond. Organizations operating in Turkey, particularly media outlets and non-governmental organization (NGOs), should be aware of surveillance, website blocking, and potential personnel detentions over online content critical of the Turkish Government.

14	 Threat activity toward the government sector is primarily driven by the sensitive information contained at these agencies that can prove valuable for both state-sponsored and financially motivated threat actors. In 2020, this has included coronavirus treatment and response data. Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that state-sponsored threat actors frequently pose a severe threat to governments. We observed Russian, Chinese, Iranian, North Korean, Vietnamese, and Indian cyber espionage actors compromise governments. We assess with high confidence that cyber criminals regularly pose a moderate to severe threat to governments. In addition to FIN11, we have detected several UNC groups target national and regional government organizations with ransomware. We detected multiple information operations targeting governments, likely as a means to various geopolitical ends, including to undermine leaders, institutions, and adversaries, promote certain candidates for positions of power, delegitimize elections, or foment divisions amongst a populace. We assess with moderate confidence this threat activity poses a moderately frequent, severe threat to government organizations. Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that hacktivist groups regularly pose a low-impact risk to the government sector. We observed hacktivists conduct web defacements of government targets likely to protest policies or promote political ideologies.

15	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that state-sponsored cyber espionage activity poses a regular frequency, moderate intensity threat to the media and entertainment industry. We judge that information operations pose a persistent, serious threat to the sector. By nature, information operations seek to mimic, leverage, and manipulate legitimate media and entertainment platforms, practitioners, and consumers in order to deliver messages to diverse audiences. Mandiant believes that financially motivated activity poses a very common, moderate intensity threat to the media and entertainment sector. Due to frequent handling of consumer transactions, media and entertainment organizations face elevated risk of certain types of activity, such as point-of-sale (POS) threats, gift card abuse, and mobile malware. We assess with moderate confidence that hacktivism poses a somewhat regular frequency but limited intensity threat to the media and entertainment industry.

17	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that Russian cyber espionage operations presented a very common and serious threat to multiple industry sectors during late 2019 and 2020. Its operations are most frequently observed targeting governments in Russia's near abroad and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states, particularly Poland, Ukraine, and the U.S. Increased public exposure from primarily the U.S. and UK Governments provided unusual insight into these operations. Likewise, we assess with high confidence that Russian information operations present a very common and serious threat to countries and organizations in NATO and Russia's near abroad, particularly to media organizations and governments as well as nonprofit organizations, political parties, and international organizations. Mandiant assesses with high confidence that Russian-language cyber crime will continue to pose an almost continuous and serious threat to global organizations, with financially motivated activity from Russia targeting nearly every industry sector worldwide.

18	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that cyber espionage from primarily Russian state-linked threat groups will continue to present an almost continuous and serious threat to Ukraine particularly toward Ukrainian government and military entities. Mandiant has observed primarily pro-Russian information operations targeting Ukraine, often with the apparent objective of creating tension between Ukraine and its European and NATO partners and degrading Ukrainians' trust in their government and democracy. We assess with moderate confidence that these information operations are a frequent and considerable threat. We assess with moderate confidence that Ukrainian cyber crime poses a frequent, moderate magnitude threat to organizations located both in Ukraine and globally.

20	 Ensuring data integrity and security as well as operational security during times of disruption or increased remote work is critical. Remote workers should be advised on how to best secure their workplaces, remote work security policies, and access controls should be reviewed and clearly communicated; and special attention should be paid to the possibility of insider threats. Organizations facing disruption events that require increased remote work should ensure that they have sufficient infrastructure, capacity, and device security policies and controls. This can range from making sure that users have secure means to access internal systems remotely and having policies regarding the use of personal devices for work, to developing plans for access to highly secure and/or air gapped systems that should not be exposed to the internet. As the types of events that could cause business disruptions and increased remote work are almost certainly events that would garner significant regional or international attention, they are likely to be used for social engineering lures by a variety of actors. User education intended to drive increased awareness and wariness regarding potential phishing can be a core mitigation tactic in reducing the risk from this type of campaign.

25	 Mandiant incident response investigations and open-source information demonstrate that UNC2452, UNC2652, and likely related activity clusters pursued multiple third-party compromises in 2020 and 2021. Third-party compromises afford tactical and operational advantages to attackers compared to direct targeting. A single compromise can facilitate access to multiple potential targets, and victims may be less likely to detect an intrusion that abuses a trusted channel. We assess with high confidence that this activity represents a risk for governments and policy organizations in North America and Europe and the technology service providers that support these entities. We believe that UNC2452 and related clusters have maintained operational tempo and priorities despite significant public attention. We expect UNC2452 and related clusters to continue to conduct multiple simultaneous, complex intrusions, including operations involving third-party and software supply chain compromise, in pursuit of strategic intelligence requirements that support Russian state interests.

34	 FireEye Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the cyber espionage threat to national governments is severe. Nation-state threat actors frequently target other governments to gain access to political, diplomatic, economic, and military intelligence. We assess with moderate confidence that the information operations threat to national governments is high. Nation-states increasingly engage in information operations meant to affect government policies, influence national elections, and undermine public confidence in national institutions. FireEye Intelligence judges that hacktivism typically presents a frequent but limited impact threat to well-patched national government systems.

35	" Tor (formerly The Onion Router) is a network that is purpose-built for anonymized internet browsing that also facilitates the use of ""dark web"" sites inaccessible to software that is not Tor-compatible. Tor has long been used for a wide variety of activities, both legitimate and illicit. Groups and actors observed leveraging Tor range from average cyber criminals using marketplaces hosted on Tor .onion sites to espionage actors using domain fronting Tor plugins for remote access that purports to be legitimate traffic. Actors linked to Tor use include APT29, FIN4, and various opportunistic financially motivated threat actors. Options for blocking and mitigating threats related to Tor in an enterprise environment exist, but they are not absolute. Nearly any mitigation option will still leave opportunities for determined individuals to access Tor through a corporate network, as Tor traffic can often look similar to other types of traffic. Given the many anonymity-related advantages that the use of Tor can provide to cyber threat actors, FireEye Threat Intelligence is highly confident that the use of Tor for malicious purposes will continue for the foreseeable future.

36	 FireEye Intelligence assesses with high confidence that cyber espionage actors pose a serious threat to law firms. Cyber espionage actors, particularly those with a nexus to China, are likely to target law firms to exploit trusted client relationships and gain access to intellectual property or proprietary information to benefit a government sponsor. We assess with high confidence that financially motivated cyber crime poses an ongoing and serious threat to law firms. Financially motivated cyber criminals target legal firms to gain access to client data such as financial and account information, proprietary information, or other sensitive business data. FireEye Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that hacktivists constitute a low threat to law firms. Hacktivists may target law firms to call attention to a cause, but they typically possess limited technical capabilities. Cyber threats to legal services come in various forms including phishing, data breaches, ransomware, supply chain compromise, and insider threats. Moreover, lack of security training and usage of obsolete technology and mobile devices increase the security risk to the law firms.

38	 The cyber espionage threat to the telecommunications sector is high. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has observed more than 40 advanced threat actors that have conducted operations against telecommunications companies throughout Asia, Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Australia. Financially motivated cyber crime poses a high threat to telecommunications companies and their customers. Telecommunications companies are less frequently directly targeted by these actors, but often collaborate extensively with customers and law enforcement to mitigate criminal threats. Hacktivists constitute a moderate threat to the telecommunications sector. Motivations to target the sector include support of net neutrality, retaliation for perceived injustices, and promotion of nationalist themes. The sector must also consider its position as a key node in the overall critical infrastructure of most countries. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, physical sabotage, jamming, and supply chain attacks pose additional risks.

39	 FireEye Intelligence continues to observe state-sponsored and other threat actors target national elections to collect intelligence and exert influence as well as attempt to delegitimize or disrupt the electoral process. We assess with high confidence that actors will persist in targeting entities associated with elections. Based on activity observed from 2016 2019, we believe that threat actors have focused their targeting against electoral platforms affecting public opinion, such as news organizations, political parties, and other entities with comparatively larger attack surfaces than core election systems. While we have observed one credible instance of a core elections system being successfully compromised, we have not observed evidence of any instances that resulted in alteration or manipulation of votes . FireEye Intelligence anticipates that future threat scenarios could include disruptive threats such as ransomware attacks impacting electoral processes and related organizations.

40	 We assess with high confidence that Russian and Chinese espionage actors consistently pose a high-frequency, high-impact threat to U.S. entities. Future targets are likely to include entities connected to the upcoming U.S. election and entities involved in defense, diplomacy, and/or policymaking. Iran and North Korea also pose a potentially destructive threat based on current geopolitical tensions and past activity. Information operations that support Russian or Iranian interests pose a high-frequency, moderate-impact threat. We have also observed campaigns targeting the U.S. that do not appear to support state interests and at least one campaign that may have been orchestrated by a marketing firm in support of a third party that appeared to support state interests. We assess with high confidence that the U.S. will remain a high-frequency target of both targeted and opportunistic financially motivated cyber activity for the foreseeable future. Operations range from low to high impact. We assess with moderate confidence that the perceived lucrative nature of high-impact operations, such as targeted ransomware infections, may cause additional actors to adopt these tactics. We assess with moderate confidence that hacktivist groups will continue choosing U.S. targets for demonstrative cyber activity; however, most activity will not constitute a threat to security-conscious and well-resourced entities. We assess with moderate confidence that an increasing number of countries will demonstrate offensive cyber capabilities in the coming years. Based on the prominence of the cyber domain in modern economic and political competition and the growing presence of private companies offering offensive capabilities for sale, the number of U.S. cyber adversaries is liable to increase and diversify.

43	 While cloud providers are responsible for providing security controls, customers are responsible for using those measures and protecting their data. Cloud service providers are attractive targets for both espionage and financially motivated cyber threat actors due to the vast amount of data stored in the cloud from many different users. Many cloud data breaches are linked to weak passwords, weak authentication, or poor certificate and key management. Threat actors attempt to compromise cloud services to scale their computing capabilities and improve their anonymity. They also use legitimate cloud services as infrastructure supporting malicious operations. Organizations using multi-factor authentication and integrating user permissions in their systems have fared much better when targeted by persistent cyber threats. Proper configurations, accurate inventory, and consumption tracking of decentralized assets are among the best practices for cloud security.

However, historical activity and the general risk associated with conference attendance suggests that potential attendees should consider the risks associated with travelling to the summit. We have seen espionage actors regularly target conferences and their attendees. The prominence of the summit and many of its attendees will almost certainly draw the attention of actors seeking to gain access to sensitive devices, networks, or data.

48	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that state-sponsored activity poses a regular-frequency, moderate-intensity threat to the United Kingdom. The geopolitical and economic significance of the nation makes it an attractive target for state-sponsored threats seeking strategic intelligence to support their military, pollical, and economic objectives. We judge that information operations continue to pose a moderate-frequency, moderate-severity threat to the UK, and we have detected inauthentic coordinated social media networks supporting various state interests, including those of Russia and Iran. Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that financially motivated threat activity poses a high-frequency, serious-intensity threat to the UK, and we continue to observe threat actors leverage ransomware and phishing sites as part of their campaigns. Hacktivists pose a rare, low-severity threat to the UK; however, notable events can potentially motivate these threats to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and data leaks, if provoked.

49	 Cyber crime is responsible for most attacks directed against hospitality companies. Cyber criminals use several methods to capitalize on a successful attack, theft of payment and sensitive data, and extortive attacks. The cyber espionage threat to the hospitality industry is dependent on the company's location and its political and social environment. Nation-state actors increasingly target the sector to collect information on hotel guests of interest, gather corporate information, and conduct destructive attacks. Hacktivism poses a minor threat to organizations in the hospitality industry. Targeting of entities in the hospitality sector primarily occurs opportunistically or as part of broader campaigns against multiple targets. The adaptation of internet of things (IoT) technology broadens the concerns about new cyber security risks.

These operations likely target technology organizations to obtain proprietary data that could be used for military or commercial advantage, or to facilitate third-party and supply chain compromises. We assess with moderate confidence that financially motivated actors pose a significant, high-frequency threat to the technology industry. Common activity types include ransomware, theft of personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data, credential compromise, and sale of access to technology companies. Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that information operations are a nearly continuous but limited impact threat to social media organizations, primarily through credential theft, platform abuse, and reputation damage. These operations also likely pose an uncommon threat with negligible impact to other subsectors.

53	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that Russian state-sponsored cyber espionage continues to present a very common and serious threat to many industries, but particularly to governments worldwide. Russian cyber espionage operations overwhelmingly targeted the United States. We assess with high confidence that Russian-speaking cyber criminals will continue to pose an almost continuous and serious threat to global organizations, with financially motivated activity from Russia targeting nearly every industry sector worldwide. A growing number of extremely high-profile ransomware infections has begun to garner an increasing focus from national and international law enforcement organizations, as the disruption from these infections continues to rise. Pro-Russian information operations continue to target primarily NATO states, with a particular focus on nations in Russia's Near Abroad and the United States. These campaigns pose a moderate intensity and magnitude threat to targeted societies and governments. We observed few instances of genuine hacktivism based in Russia.

We believe that the number of supply chain compromises with a suspected financial motivation has increased overall and in proportion to suspected state-sponsored incidents. Mandiant has noted numerous examples of supply chain compromises that were introduced by malicious actors into third-party code repositories or other collaborative resources, as well as a few instances of malicious code being introduced by insiders, and devices shipped with malware pre-installed. We anticipate that supply chain compromises will continue to increase, given defender difficulty in detecting and preventing abuse of trusted channels, as well as attacker incentives including the efficiency gain of a single compromise potentially affecting many victims.

65	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that Russia will conduct additional destructive or disruptive cyber attacks connected to the crisis in Ukraine. Russian cyber attacks almost certainly will focus first on Ukraine, with Western/NATO allies also being possible targets. NATO and Western sanctions and responses likely will heavily influence Russia's perception of high-priority targets for retaliation, and Russian action may be focused against the financial industry, oil and gas sector, and media and entertainment. Organizations making statements condemning Russian aggression and/or supporting Ukraine and organizations taking actions to restrict Russian participation in international commerce, competitions, and events face elevated risk of future reprisal. We assess that Sandworm and UNC2589 are two of the most likely actors to conduct cyber attacks in retaliation, although we judge that all high-profile Russian threat actors will continue or increase cyber espionage to enhance decision advantage against Ukrainian and NATO government targets.

70	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the Russian Federation directs a series of sophisticated, long-standing cyber espionage programs that conduct threat activity and information operations globally against targets of interest to the Russian state. We have lower confidence in our attribution of some named groups to specific Russian security services due to Mandiant's lack of technical evidence associating many of these actor sets to their respective organizations. However, we draw on a wide body of open-source reporting on the mission mandates of Russian intelligence services and government attributions of specific actors to link threat groups we track to their likely sponsors. Attribution is a critical component of cyber threat intelligence because it provides insight into actor intent and helps analysts characterize current activity, anticipate future threats, and provide risk assessments to inform defensive strategies and resource allocation. We assess with high confidence that Russian-sponsored cyber threat groups represent an acute threat to governments, media and civil society organizations, and industrial control systems (ICS) in Eastern and Western Europe and North America.

72	 FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence defines Light Rail Transit (LRT) as a subcomponent of the Rail Transportation industry, focused on transporting passengers within urban or suburban areas by a vehicle on rail lines, including light rail trains, trams, and streetcars. LRT systems face potential threats from state-sponsored, financially motivated, hacktivist and terrorist-sympathetic adversaries. Insider threats are also relevant for rail transportation. Potential adverse outcomes of cyber threat activity include destruction of infrastructure, disruption of operations, economic loss, and reputational damage to the LRT system, and by extension, associated municipal or other authorities. The complex dynamics and interdependencies between different layers of rail transportation systems provide attackers with opportunities to perform attacks on a variety of different attack surfaces. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and the supply chain are among the most critical attack vectors. Third-party or external contractors in the supply chain represent risks to the integrity of the LRT system due to shared access to sensitive information and/or equipment required for the system's operation. However, proper precautions can mitigate the risks.

73	 Russia-, North Korea-, and Iran-nexus threat actors have demonstrated a willingness to conduct operations against the utilities industry in the last several years. We regularly observe indiscriminate cyber criminal campaigns impacting this sector and, albeit limited, financially motivated intrusion groups such as FIN7 have also impacted the utilities industry. Despite occasional hacktivist or disgruntled insider attacks, the current threat is low. Utilities, especially those invol v ed in electricity generation or transmission, should include geopolitical environment analyses when determining security strategies and investment priorities.

74	 FireEye Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the cyber espionage threat to national governments is severe. Nation-state threat actors frequently target other governments to gain access to political, diplomatic, economic, and military intelligence. We assess with moderate confidence that the information operations threat to national governments is high. Nation-states increasingly engage in information operations meant to affect government policies, influence national elections, and undermine public confidence in national institutions. FireEye Intelligence judges that hacktivism typically presents a frequent but limited impact threat to well-patched national government systems. However, prominent government websites have been successfully targeted by hacktivists in recent years. We assess with moderate confidence that financially motivated activity presents a moderate threat to well-patched national government systems as criminal actors commonly target vulnerable government databases to gain access to personally identifiable information (PII).

78	" FireEye Threat Intelligence predicts that high-profile events such as the 2020 Olympics and the upcoming elections in several nations will generate a variety of cyber threat activity, including state-sponsored campaigns, financially motivated activity, and information operations. Operations may include destructive or disruptive attacks. We anticipate that Russian actors will target the Olympics and elections in 2020; we warn that the potential for Iranian actors to conduct disruptive or destructive attacks is elevated; we expect the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to continue to drive Chinese state-sponsored activities; North Korean groups will likely continue to target financial institutions globally. We assess with high confidence that financially motivated actors continue to innovate and develop new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including the use of ransomware delivered post-compromise. We expect the practice of stealing data prior to deploying ransomware will become more widespread. We assess with moderate confidence that third-party and supply-chain compromises are being leveraged with increasing frequency by both financially motivated and state-sponsored actors. We assess with high confidence that information operations will expand in scope and increase in sophistication, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated ""deepfake"" images.

79	 The cyber espionage threat to the telecommunications sector is high. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has observed more than 40 advanced threat actors that have conducted operations against telecommunications companies throughout Asia, Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Australia. Financially motivated cyber crime poses a high threat to telecommunications companies and their customers. Telecommunications companies are less frequently directly targeted by these actors, but often collaborate extensively with customers and law enforcement to mitigate criminal threats. Hacktivists constitute a moderate threat to the telecommunications sector. Motivations to target the sector include support of net neutrality, retaliation for perceived injustices, and promotion of nationalist themes. The sector must also consider its position as a key node in the overall critical infrastructure of most countries. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, physical sabotage, jamming, and supply chain attacks pose additional risks.

80	 FireEye Intelligence continues to observe state-sponsored and other threat actors target national elections to collect intelligence and exert influence as well as attempt to delegitimize or disrupt the electoral process. We assess with high confidence that actors will persist in targeting entities associated with elections. Based on activity observed from 2016 2019, we believe that threat actors have focused their targeting against electoral platforms affecting public opinion, such as news organizations, political parties, and other entities with comparatively larger attack surfaces than core election systems. While we have observed one credible instance of a core elections system being successfully compromised, we have not observed evidence of any instances that resulted in alteration or manipulation of votes . FireEye Intelligence anticipates that future threat scenarios could include disruptive threats such as ransomware attacks impacting electoral processes and related organizations.

83	 FireEye Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that cyber espionage continues to pose an occasional, moderate-intensity threat to Turkish government and commercial sector entities. In the past two years, we observed Russia-, China-, Iran-, and North Korea-nexus groups targeting Turkey, including critical infrastructure targeting. Financially motivated threat activity in Turkey remains a persistent, moderate-intensity threat to multiple industries, most notably financial services. Observed activity includes targeted intrusions and opportunistic campaigns. Information operations by likely Iranian actors present a somewhat regular, low-intensity threat to Turkish audiences. Turkish information operations in support of international political objectives constitute an occasional and limited-intensity threat. Politically motivated hacktivists present a high-frequency, low-intensity threat to public and private sector entities in Turkey and beyond. Organizations operating in Turkey, particularly media outlets and non-governmental organization (NGOs), should be aware of surveillance, website blocking, and potential personnel detentions over online content critical of the Turkish Government.

84	 Threat activity toward the government sector is primarily driven by the sensitive information contained at these agencies that can prove valuable for both state-sponsored and financially motivated threat actors. In 2020, this has included coronavirus treatment and response data. Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that state-sponsored threat actors frequently pose a severe threat to governments. We observed Russian, Chinese, Iranian, North Korean, Vietnamese, and Indian cyber espionage actors compromise governments. We assess with high confidence that cyber criminals regularly pose a moderate to severe threat to governments. In addition to FIN11, we have detected several UNC groups target national and regional government organizations with ransomware. We detected multiple information operations targeting governments, likely as a means to various geopolitical ends, including to undermine leaders, institutions, and adversaries, promote certain candidates for positions of power, delegitimize elections, or foment divisions amongst a populace. We assess with moderate confidence this threat activity poses a moderately frequent, severe threat to government organizations. Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that hacktivist groups regularly pose a low-impact risk to the government sector. We observed hacktivists conduct web defacements of government targets likely to protest policies or promote political ideologies.

85	 Cyber crime is responsible for most attacks directed against hospitality companies. Cyber criminals use several methods to capitalize on a successful attack, theft of payment and sensitive data, and extortive attacks. The cyber espionage threat to the hospitality industry is dependent on the company's location and its political and social environment. Nation-state actors increasingly target the sector to collect information on hotel guests of interest, gather corporate information, and conduct destructive attacks. Hacktivism poses a minor threat to organizations in the hospitality industry. Targeting of entities in the hospitality sector primarily occurs opportunistically or as part of broader campaigns against multiple targets. The adaptation of internet of things (IoT) technology broadens the concerns about new cyber security risks.

86	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that Russian state-sponsored cyber espionage continues to present a very common and serious threat to many industries, but particularly to governments worldwide. Russian cyber espionage operations overwhelmingly targeted the United States. We assess with high confidence that Russian-speaking cyber criminals will continue to pose an almost continuous and serious threat to global organizations, with financially motivated activity from Russia targeting nearly every industry sector worldwide. A growing number of extremely high-profile ransomware infections has begun to garner an increasing focus from national and international law enforcement organizations, as the disruption from these infections continues to rise. Pro-Russian information operations continue to target primarily NATO states, with a particular focus on nations in Russia's Near Abroad and the United States. These campaigns pose a moderate intensity and magnitude threat to targeted societies and governments. We observed few instances of genuine hacktivism based in Russia.

87	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that state-sponsored cyber espionage activity poses a regular frequency, moderate intensity threat to the media and entertainment industry. We judge that information operations pose a persistent, serious threat to the sector. By nature, information operations seek to mimic, leverage, and manipulate legitimate media and entertainment platforms, practitioners, and consumers in order to deliver messages to diverse audiences. Mandiant believes that financially motivated activity poses a very common, moderate intensity threat to the media and entertainment sector. Due to frequent handling of consumer transactions, media and entertainment organizations face elevated risk of certain types of activity, such as point-of-sale (POS) threats, gift card abuse, and mobile malware. We assess with moderate confidence that hacktivism poses a somewhat regular frequency but limited intensity threat to the media and entertainment industry.

89	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that state-sponsored activity poses a regular-frequency, moderate-intensity threat to the United Kingdom. The geopolitical and economic significance of the nation makes it an attractive target for state-sponsored threats seeking strategic intelligence to support their military, pollical, and economic objectives. We judge that information operations continue to pose a moderate-frequency, moderate-severity threat to the UK, and we have detected inauthentic coordinated social media networks supporting various state interests, including those of Russia and Iran. Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that financially motivated threat activity poses a high-frequency, serious-intensity threat to the UK, and we continue to observe threat actors leverage ransomware and phishing sites as part of their campaigns. Hacktivists pose a rare, low-severity threat to the UK; however, notable events can potentially motivate these threats to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and data leaks, if provoked.

111	 The cyber espionage threat to the telecommunications sector is high. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has observed more than 40 advanced threat actors that have conducted operations against telecommunications companies throughout Asia, Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Australia. Financially motivated cyber crime poses a high threat to telecommunications companies and their customers. Telecommunications companies are less frequently directly targeted by these actors, but often collaborate extensively with customers and law enforcement to mitigate criminal threats. Hacktivists constitute a moderate threat to the telecommunications sector. Motivations to target the sector include support of net neutrality, retaliation for perceived injustices, and promotion of nationalist themes. The sector must also consider its position as a key node in the overall critical infrastructure of most countries. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, physical sabotage, jamming, and supply chain attacks pose additional risks.

112	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that financially motivated cyber threat activity is very common and has a serious impact on individuals and organizations living or operating in Latin America and the Caribbean. We have observed a wide variety of cyber crime activity in the region, ranging from detections of widely distributed malware families to targeted ransomware deployment. During the past several years we have noted Brazilian cyber crime actors expanding the geographic scope of their targeting to include the Americas and Europe. We also observed evidence of increased collaboration between the Brazilian cyber crime community and those of other Latin American countries, including Mexico and Peru. Both trends could increase the threat posed by regional actors as they gain access to additional resources and expertise. We assess with moderate confidence that cyber espionage currently presents a low-frequency, moderate-impact threat to entities in Latin America.

115	 FireEye Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the nations of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, commonly known as the Gulf Cooperation Council or GCC, are high-value targets for cyber espionage operations seeking information for political, strategic, or economic advantage and will almost certainly continue to be targeted for the foreseeable future, particularly by Iran-linked groups, but also to a lesser extent by Russian and Chinese actors. At least some GCC member states have been reported to have some degree of offensive capabilities. Iran-linked information operations have been observed during the course of 2018, referencing a variety of countries and organizations, including some GCC member states. We suspect that at least some GCC member states possess or are developing information operations capabilities, at least in part due to the ongoing diplomatic tensions following the 2017 Qatar News Agency compromise. We assess with high confidence that financially motivated threat activity is a high-volume threat to organizations and individuals in GCC countries, as it is in other developed countries. We have observed a variety of cyber crime activity affecting organizations and individuals, ranging from widely distributed malware families affecting organizations in the GCC to actors selling access to systems at companies operating in the region. Hacktivist campaigns and groups targeting both public and private entities operating in the GCC have been relatively common in the past, and we assess with moderate confidence that they will continue to be for the foreseeable future. These campaigns are likely to be of low impact in most cases, with website defacements, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and low-level leaks of sensitive or personal information.

117	 The United Kingdom (UK) is a common target for espionage actors linked to a variety of countries. The types of organizations targeted are similar to other countries with a comparable level of international engagement and economic, military, and technological development. Given its position as a wealthy and technologically advanced nation, the UK is heavily affected by cyber crime campaigns, both those targeting the UK specifically and more broadly targeted campaigns affecting many other countries. The UK has been a target and source of hacktivist activity since at least 2011 and the growth and high-profile attacks by Anonymous-affiliated actors. While high-profile hacktivism attacks appear to have decreased in prevalence in recent years, the UK will likely continue to be a popular target for hacktivists with anti-UK, anti-establishment, and/or anti-Western motivations. While we have not confidently linked any espionage groups to the UK, the UK Government has publicly admitted to developing and maintaining an offensive cyber capability.

134	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that Russian state-sponsored cyber espionage continues to present a very common and serious threat to many industries, but particularly to governments worldwide. Russian cyber espionage operations overwhelmingly targeted the United States. We assess with high confidence that Russian-speaking cyber criminals will continue to pose an almost continuous and serious threat to global organizations, with financially motivated activity from Russia targeting nearly every industry sector worldwide. A growing number of extremely high-profile ransomware infections has begun to garner an increasing focus from national and international law enforcement organizations, as the disruption from these infections continues to rise. Pro-Russian information operations continue to target primarily NATO states, with a particular focus on nations in Russia's Near Abroad and the United States. These campaigns pose a moderate intensity and magnitude threat to targeted societies and governments. We observed few instances of genuine hacktivism based in Russia.

137	 Cyber espionage operations from Russia are highly active and effective, conducting aggressive campaigns against a wide variety of targets in line with Russian strategic and tactical interests. Russian information operations are actively used to influence foreign elections, political processes, and opinions regarding various issues. Financially motivated cyber crime operations conducted by Russian actors remain a significant threat to many organizations, particularly in Western countries. This activity has affected organizations ranging in size from small, local financial organizations to large, multinational corporations. Hacktivism conducted by Russian actors is typically politically motivated; Russian Government offices, officials, and media outlets are often targeted by both foreign and domestic hacktivists in response to perceived physical or political aggression by the Russian Government.

141	 Ensuring data integrity and security as well as operational security during times of disruption or increased remote work is critical. Remote workers should be advised on how to best secure their workplaces, remote work security policies, and access controls should be reviewed and clearly communicated; and special attention should be paid to the possibility of insider threats. Organizations facing disruption events that require increased remote work should ensure that they have sufficient infrastructure, capacity, and device security policies and controls. This can range from making sure that users have secure means to access internal systems remotely and having policies regarding the use of personal devices for work, to developing plans for access to highly secure and/or air gapped systems that should not be exposed to the internet. As the types of events that could cause business disruptions and increased remote work are almost certainly events that would garner significant regional or international attention, they are likely to be used for social engineering lures by a variety of actors. User education intended to drive increased awareness and wariness regarding potential phishing can be a core mitigation tactic in reducing the risk from this type of campaign.

142	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that Russia will conduct additional destructive or disruptive cyber attacks connected to the crisis in Ukraine. Russian cyber attacks almost certainly will focus first on Ukraine, with Western/NATO allies also being possible targets. NATO and Western sanctions and responses likely will heavily influence Russia's perception of high-priority targets for retaliation, and Russian action may be focused against the financial industry, oil and gas sector, and media and entertainment. Organizations making statements condemning Russian aggression and/or supporting Ukraine and organizations taking actions to restrict Russian participation in international commerce, competitions, and events face elevated risk of future reprisal. We assess that Sandworm and UNC2589 are two of the most likely actors to conduct cyber attacks in retaliation, although we judge that all high-profile Russian threat actors will continue or increase cyber espionage to enhance decision advantage against Ukrainian and NATO government targets.

143	 The Olympic Games have historically attracted a range of cyber threat activity by various actors, including nation-states, cyber criminals, and hacktivists. Based on emerging threats, the host country and historical trends, there is likely an elevated threat to the 2018 Winter Olympics from nation-state-backed cyber espionage groups, follow-on information operations, and even nationalist hacktivist groups, in particular from Russia and North Korea. The threat of large-scale participatory hacktivist activity by independent hacktivist actors and groups to the 2018 Winter Olympics is likely diminished in comparison to previous Olympics. Financially motivated cyber criminal activity will likely seek to target consumers and exploit point-of-sale (POS) terminals, ATMs, travel, and hospitality infrastructure related to the Winter Olympics. However, it is unlikely to present as severe a threat compared to the 2016 Summer Olympics.

148	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the Russian Federation directs a series of sophisticated, long-standing cyber espionage programs that conduct threat activity and information operations globally against targets of interest to the Russian state. We have lower confidence in our attribution of some named groups to specific Russian security services due to Mandiant's lack of technical evidence associating many of these actor sets to their respective organizations. However, we draw on a wide body of open-source reporting on the mission mandates of Russian intelligence services and government attributions of specific actors to link threat groups we track to their likely sponsors. Attribution is a critical component of cyber threat intelligence because it provides insight into actor intent and helps analysts characterize current activity, anticipate future threats, and provide risk assessments to inform defensive strategies and resource allocation. We assess with high confidence that Russian-sponsored cyber threat groups represent an acute threat to governments, media and civil society organizations, and industrial control systems (ICS) in Eastern and Western Europe and North America.

We assess with low confidence that financially motivated exploitation of air-gapped systems is rare based on limited evidence of financially motivated interest in air-gapped systems, particularly ""cold"" cryptocurrency wallets. FireEye Threat Intelligence suggests that removable devices are introduced to air-gapped environments by insiders, both witting and unwitting, or individuals who obtain unauthorized physical access to a system, such as visitors. Although researchers have demonstrated novel methodologies to exfiltrate data from air-gapped systems, FireEye has not observed these means used in the wild.

152	 The number of zero-days exploited as of July 2021 is on track to more than double the previous record volume from 2019 and has already surpassed all previous years on record. State-sponsored groups continue to be the primary actors exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, although the proportion of financially motivated actors deploying zero-day exploits has grown significantly since 2019. Microsoft's Exchange and Windows Server software, Apple's iOS, and Google's Chrome browser had the highest volume of zero-days exploited by threat actors, likely reflecting the popularity of these products. The vast increase in zero-day exploitation in 2021, as well as the diversification in motives and actors using them, expands the risk portfolio for organizations in nearly every industry sector and geography, particularly those that rely on these popular systems.

153	 FireEye Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the cyber espionage threat to national governments is severe. Nation-state threat actors frequently target other governments to gain access to political, diplomatic, economic, and military intelligence. We assess with moderate confidence that the information operations threat to national governments is high. Nation-states increasingly engage in information operations meant to affect government policies, influence national elections, and undermine public confidence in national institutions. FireEye Intelligence judges that hacktivism typically presents a frequent but limited impact threat to well-patched national government systems. However, prominent government websites have been successfully targeted by hacktivists in recent years. We assess with moderate confidence that financially motivated activity presents a moderate threat to well-patched national government systems as criminal actors commonly target vulnerable government databases to gain access to personally identifiable information (PII).

157	" FireEye Threat Intelligence predicts that high-profile events such as the 2020 Olympics and the upcoming elections in several nations will generate a variety of cyber threat activity, including state-sponsored campaigns, financially motivated activity, and information operations. Operations may include destructive or disruptive attacks. We anticipate that Russian actors will target the Olympics and elections in 2020; we warn that the potential for Iranian actors to conduct disruptive or destructive attacks is elevated; we expect the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to continue to drive Chinese state-sponsored activities; North Korean groups will likely continue to target financial institutions globally. We assess with high confidence that financially motivated actors continue to innovate and develop new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including the use of ransomware delivered post-compromise. We expect the practice of stealing data prior to deploying ransomware will become more widespread. We assess with moderate confidence that third-party and supply-chain compromises are being leveraged with increasing frequency by both financially motivated and state-sponsored actors. We assess with high confidence that information operations will expand in scope and increase in sophistication, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated ""deepfake"" images.

158	 FireEye Intelligence continues to observe state-sponsored and other threat actors target national elections to collect intelligence and exert influence as well as attempt to delegitimize or disrupt the electoral process. We assess with high confidence that actors will persist in targeting entities associated with elections. Based on activity observed from 2016 2019, we believe that threat actors have focused their targeting against electoral platforms affecting public opinion, such as news organizations, political parties, and other entities with comparatively larger attack surfaces than core election systems. While we have observed one credible instance of a core elections system being successfully compromised, we have not observed evidence of any instances that resulted in alteration or manipulation of votes . FireEye Intelligence anticipates that future threat scenarios could include disruptive threats such as ransomware attacks impacting electoral processes and related organizations.

159	 We assess with high confidence that Russian and Chinese espionage actors consistently pose a high-frequency, high-impact threat to U.S. entities. Future targets are likely to include entities connected to the upcoming U.S. election and entities involved in defense, diplomacy, and/or policymaking. Iran and North Korea also pose a potentially destructive threat based on current geopolitical tensions and past activity. Information operations that support Russian or Iranian interests pose a high-frequency, moderate-impact threat. We have also observed campaigns targeting the U.S. that do not appear to support state interests and at least one campaign that may have been orchestrated by a marketing firm in support of a third party that appeared to support state interests. We assess with high confidence that the U.S. will remain a high-frequency target of both targeted and opportunistic financially motivated cyber activity for the foreseeable future. Operations range from low to high impact. We assess with moderate confidence that the perceived lucrative nature of high-impact operations, such as targeted ransomware infections, may cause additional actors to adopt these tactics. We assess with moderate confidence that hacktivist groups will continue choosing U.S. targets for demonstrative cyber activity; however, most activity will not constitute a threat to security-conscious and well-resourced entities. We assess with moderate confidence that an increasing number of countries will demonstrate offensive cyber capabilities in the coming years. Based on the prominence of the cyber domain in modern economic and political competition and the growing presence of private companies offering offensive capabilities for sale, the number of U.S. cyber adversaries is liable to increase and diversify.

160	 The U.S. Government and U.S. companies have been targeted by almost every advanced persistent threat (APT) group that FireEye tracks, but threat levels vary by country nexus. Russia- and North Korea-nexus threat actors pose the highest immediate risk. The financially motivated cyber crime threat to the U.S. is high. Credential theft malware, ransomware, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are prevalent threats, but targeted intrusion operations by sophisticated FIN groups likely cause the greatest financial and reputational impact per incident. Hacktivist activity remains a constant (but low-level) threat to many U.S. entities, with pro-ISIS and pro-extremist groups representing the greatest potential threat. Public-facing threat activity that mimics hacktivism, but is most likely attributable to state actors, represents a significant, growing threat to the U.S. Government, U.S. institutions, and sectors including financial, media and entertainment, and civil society. We have observed this type of activity from Russia-, North Korea-, and Iran-nexus actors. Various geopolitical developments will likely influence risk management for U.S. entities, including changing U.S. foreign policy priorities, the reorganization of various federal agencies, the rollout of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and ongoing tensions with Russia.

161	 Domain Name System (DNS) hijacking takes place when a malicious actor interferes with the DNS look-up process in order to redirect a user's activity to an attacker-chosen destination to monitor, intercept, redirect, or interrupt traffic. While this technique is not new, Mandiant Threat Intelligence continues to observe it being used by a wide variety of actors, including what we suspect to be Iranian state-sponsored espionage actors. Malicious actors have used DNS hijacking to facilitate espionage operations, financially motivated credential theft (pharming), ransomware distribution, website defacement, and click fraud. We have also observed local DNS manipulation being used to obfuscate malware command and control (C C) callbacks. We anticipate that DNS manipulation will continue to be used by malicious actors for the foreseeable future, as it offers a relatively easy and cost-effective method for actors to scale their operations widely.

164	 Shadow IT typically refers to technology projects and platforms that are managed outside of, and without the knowledge of, the IT department. Shadow IT use, including use of personal devices, public repositories, and personal email, cloud storage, and social media accounts, can both introduce vectors for malicious activity to enter the enterprise environment and result in corporate data and assets leaving systems and networks protected and monitored by IT and IT security staff. In disruptive work circumstances, such as an urgent meeting or trip, or an unexpected mass shift to remote work, users may be more likely to resort to shadow IT solutions, particularly if approved and monitored IT solutions are inaccessible or inconvenient. Implementing security policies or controls that are more restrictive can provide users additional incentives to go outside of IT managed assets. An IT group that is reasonable and responsive to user requests and concerns is much more likely to have users bring issues or ideas forward to find a collaborative solution that is both secure and fulfills employee use cases.

165	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence suggests that the expedient implementation of emergency preparedness measures generates compounding benefits for organizations beyond the immediate goal of improving defenses against an imminent threat. In early 2020, Iranian general Qasem Soleimani's death in a U.S. airstrike led Mandiant to advise organizations to prepare for potential retaliatory Iranian cyber threat activity. Specifically, we suggested prioritizing detection of the initial stages of intrusions and implementing mitigations against commonly observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) Iranian espionage actors employ. Although we have not observed a dramatic increase in the frequency of Iranian operations or significant destructive operations targeting the U.S. or its allies as of July 2021, we suggest that organizations that implemented recommended countermeasures are not only better prepared to defend against potential Iranian activity, but they are also better prepared to counter threat activity from numerous additional threat actors who employ the same or similar TTPs. We expect that these TTPs will remain popular among diverse threat actors for at least the near to mid-term due to their proven effectiveness.

166	 State-sponsored cyber espionage as well as disruptive and destructive attacks continue to pose the greatest threats to the aerospace and defense industry. China-, North Korea-, Iran-, and Russia-nexus actors have all recently targeted the industry with extensive reconnaissance that could facilitate espionage campaigns as well as destructive and disruptive attacks. Aerospace and defense sector entities should be sensitive to the threat of information operations from nations adversarial to their business partners, as such activity can pose a reputational risk. Financially motivated cyber threat activity represents an ongoing moderate threat to the aerospace and defense industry. The sector is impacted by cyber crime campaigns that commonly target commercial entities across verticals, although the paucity of compromised data or domain access being offered on underground forums indicates that the sector is less frequently compromised than others. Hacktivism represents a low threat to the aerospace and defense industry. Although we infrequently observe hacktivist activity targeting the aerospace and defense sector, an organization's perceived involvement in controversies surrounding ethnic, nationalist, environmental, or health concerns may prompt targeting by aggrieved individuals or collectives.

167	 Threat activity toward the government sector is primarily driven by the sensitive information contained at these agencies that can prove valuable for both state-sponsored and financially motivated threat actors. In 2020, this has included coronavirus treatment and response data. Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that state-sponsored threat actors frequently pose a severe threat to governments. We observed Russian, Chinese, Iranian, North Korean, Vietnamese, and Indian cyber espionage actors compromise governments. We assess with high confidence that cyber criminals regularly pose a moderate to severe threat to governments. In addition to FIN11, we have detected several UNC groups target national and regional government organizations with ransomware. We detected multiple information operations targeting governments, likely as a means to various geopolitical ends, including to undermine leaders, institutions, and adversaries, promote certain candidates for positions of power, delegitimize elections, or foment divisions amongst a populace. We assess with moderate confidence this threat activity poses a moderately frequent, severe threat to government organizations. Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that hacktivist groups regularly pose a low-impact risk to the government sector.

172	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that state-sponsored cyber espionage activity poses a regular frequency, moderate intensity threat to the media and entertainment industry. We judge that information operations pose a persistent, serious threat to the sector. By nature, information operations seek to mimic, leverage, and manipulate legitimate media and entertainment platforms, practitioners, and consumers in order to deliver messages to diverse audiences. Mandiant believes that financially motivated activity poses a very common, moderate intensity threat to the media and entertainment sector. Due to frequent handling of consumer transactions, media and entertainment organizations face elevated risk of certain types of activity, such as point-of-sale (POS) threats, gift card abuse, and mobile malware. We assess with moderate confidence that hacktivism poses a somewhat regular frequency but limited intensity threat to the media and entertainment industry.

174	 The cyber espionage threat to Japan is very high. The resurgence of APT10 and its high operational tempo against Japanese targets constitutes a particularly acute threat. Japanese entities face a high threat of cyber crime. Ongoing and serious risks include credential theft malware, ransomware, and Chinese criminal activity. Hacktivist actors pose a low threat to Japanese enterprise networks. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are commonly used to promote political messages. Japan's growing geopolitical and military activeness, especially as a result of tensions in the South China Sea and the Korean Peninsula, will likely continue to drive cyber threat activity for the next several years. The run-up to Japan's hosting of the Summer Olympics in 2020 will be a strategic challenge for the country as it seeks to strengthen cyber security in its public and private sectors.

175	 Cyber crime is responsible for most attacks directed against hospitality companies. Cyber criminals use several methods to capitalize on a successful attack, theft of payment and sensitive data, and extortive attacks. The cyber espionage threat to the hospitality industry is dependent on the company's location and its political and social environment. Nation-state actors increasingly target the sector to collect information on hotel guests of interest, gather corporate information, and conduct destructive attacks. Hacktivism poses a minor threat to organizations in the hospitality industry. Targeting of entities in the hospitality sector primarily occurs opportunistically or as part of broader campaigns against multiple targets. The adaptation of internet of things (IoT) technology broadens the concerns about new cyber security risks.

176	 Pakistani espionage activity is often associated with targeting of India due to the history of conflicts between the regional rivals, but the activity has also been observed supporting other Pakistani military and diplomatic interests globally. Cyber crime activity originating in Pakistan likely poses a low to moderate threat, though organizations based or operating in India potentially face a greater threat due to the historical and ongoing conflicts between the countries. Organizations and individuals in Pakistan are targets for cyber criminals and likely face a moderate threat from this type of activity in both opportunistic campaigns and those targeting specific organizations or industries. Hacktivist actors from Pakistan have primarily been motivated by pro-Islam and anti-India ideologies and typically conduct website defacements and other low-level activity. Similarly, pro-India actors are one of the most common types of hacktivists targeting Pakistani organizations and are generally limited to website defacements.

177	 FireEye Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the nations of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, commonly known as the Gulf Cooperation Council or GCC, are high-value targets for cyber espionage operations seeking information for political, strategic, or economic advantage and will almost certainly continue to be targeted for the foreseeable future, particularly by Iran-linked groups, but also to a lesser extent by Russian and Chinese actors. At least some GCC member states have been reported to have some degree of offensive capabilities. Iran-linked information operations have been observed during the course of 2018, referencing a variety of countries and organizations, including some GCC member states. We suspect that at least some GCC member states possess or are developing information operations capabilities, at least in part due to the ongoing diplomatic tensions following the 2017 Qatar News Agency compromise. We assess with high confidence that financially motivated threat activity is a high-volume threat to organizations and individuals in GCC countries, as it is in other developed countries. We have observed a variety of cyber crime activity affecting organizations and individuals, ranging from widely distributed malware families affecting organizations in the GCC to actors selling access to systems at companies operating in the region. Hacktivist campaigns and groups targeting both public and private entities operating in the GCC have been relatively common in the past, and we assess with moderate confidence that they will continue to be for the foreseeable future. These campaigns are likely to be of low impact in most cases, with website defacements, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and low-level leaks of sensitive or personal information.

179	 The United Kingdom (UK) is a common target for espionage actors linked to a variety of countries. The types of organizations targeted are similar to other countries with a comparable level of international engagement and economic, military, and technological development. Given its position as a wealthy and technologically advanced nation, the UK is heavily affected by cyber crime campaigns, both those targeting the UK specifically and more broadly targeted campaigns affecting many other countries. The UK has been a target and source of hacktivist activity since at least 2011 and the growth and high-profile attacks by Anonymous-affiliated actors. While high-profile hacktivism attacks appear to have decreased in prevalence in recent years, the UK will likely continue to be a popular target for hacktivists with anti-UK, anti-establishment, and/or anti-Western motivations. While we have not confidently linked any espionage groups to the UK, the UK Government has publicly admitted to developing and maintaining an offensive cyber capability.

210	 FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence defines Light Rail Transit (LRT) as a subcomponent of the Rail Transportation industry, focused on transporting passengers within urban or suburban areas by a vehicle on rail lines, including light rail trains, trams, and streetcars. LRT systems face potential threats from state-sponsored, financially motivated, hacktivist and terrorist-sympathetic adversaries. Insider threats are also relevant for rail transportation. Potential adverse outcomes of cyber threat activity include destruction of infrastructure, disruption of operations, economic loss, and reputational damage to the LRT system, and by extension, associated municipal or other authorities. The complex dynamics and interdependencies between different layers of rail transportation systems provide attackers with opportunities to perform attacks on a variety of different attack surfaces. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and the supply chain are among the most critical attack vectors. Third-party or external contractors in the supply chain represent risks to the integrity of the LRT system due to shared access to sensitive information and/or equipment required for the system's operation. However, proper precautions can mitigate the risks.

211	 Russia-, North Korea-, and Iran-nexus threat actors have demonstrated a willingness to conduct operations against the utilities industry in the last several years. We regularly observe indiscriminate cyber criminal campaigns impacting this sector and, albeit limited, financially motivated intrusion groups such as FIN7 have also impacted the utilities industry. Despite occasional hacktivist or disgruntled insider attacks, the current threat is low. Utilities, especially those invol v ed in electricity generation or transmission, should include geopolitical environment analyses when determining security strategies and investment priorities.

212	 FireEye Intelligence assesses with high confidence that cyber espionage actors pose a serious threat to law firms. Cyber espionage actors, particularly those with a nexus to China, are likely to target law firms to exploit trusted client relationships and gain access to intellectual property or proprietary information to benefit a government sponsor. We assess with high confidence that financially motivated cyber crime poses an ongoing and serious threat to law firms. Financially motivated cyber criminals target legal firms to gain access to client data such as financial and account information, proprietary information, or other sensitive business data. FireEye Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that hacktivists constitute a low threat to law firms. Hacktivists may target law firms to call attention to a cause, but they typically possess limited technical capabilities. Cyber threats to legal services come in various forms including phishing, data breaches, ransomware, supply chain compromise, and insider threats. Moreover, lack of security training and usage of obsolete technology and mobile devices increase the security risk to the law firms.

214	" FireEye Threat Intelligence predicts that high-profile events such as the 2020 Olympics and the upcoming elections in several nations will generate a variety of cyber threat activity, including state-sponsored campaigns, financially motivated activity, and information operations. Operations may include destructive or disruptive attacks. We anticipate that Russian actors will target the Olympics and elections in 2020; we warn that the potential for Iranian actors to conduct disruptive or destructive attacks is elevated; we expect the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to continue to drive Chinese state-sponsored activities; North Korean groups will likely continue to target financial institutions globally. We assess with high confidence that financially motivated actors continue to innovate and develop new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including the use of ransomware delivered post-compromise. We expect the practice of stealing data prior to deploying ransomware will become more widespread. We assess with moderate confidence that third-party and supply-chain compromises are being leveraged with increasing frequency by both financially motivated and state-sponsored actors. We assess with high confidence that information operations will expand in scope and increase in sophistication, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated ""deepfake"" images.

215	 The cyber espionage threat to the telecommunications sector is high. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has observed more than 40 advanced threat actors that have conducted operations against telecommunications companies throughout Asia, Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Australia. Financially motivated cyber crime poses a high threat to telecommunications companies and their customers. Telecommunications companies are less frequently directly targeted by these actors, but often collaborate extensively with customers and law enforcement to mitigate criminal threats. Hacktivists constitute a moderate threat to the telecommunications sector. Motivations to target the sector include support of net neutrality, retaliation for perceived injustices, and promotion of nationalist themes. The sector must also consider its position as a key node in the overall critical infrastructure of most countries. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, physical sabotage, jamming, and supply chain attacks pose additional risks. 	Initial Access: T1195 Supply Chain Compromise	FIN7	Financially motivated cyber crime poses a high threat to telecommunications companies and their customers.	0:00:00.027343
216	 We assess with high confidence that Russian and Chinese espionage actors consistently pose a high-frequency, high-impact threat to U.S. entities. Future targets are likely to include entities connected to the upcoming U.S. election and entities involved in defense, diplomacy, and/or policymaking. Iran and North Korea also pose a potentially destructive threat based on current geopolitical tensions and past activity. Information operations that support Russian or Iranian interests pose a high-frequency, moderate-impact threat. We have also observed campaigns targeting the U.S. that do not appear to support state interests and at least one campaign that may have been orchestrated by a marketing firm in support of a third party that appeared to support state interests. We assess with high confidence that the U.S. will remain a high-frequency target of both targeted and opportunistic financially motivated cyber activity for the foreseeable future. Operations range from low to high impact. We assess with moderate confidence that the perceived lucrative nature of high-impact operations, such as targeted ransomware infections, may cause additional actors to adopt these tactics. We assess with moderate confidence that hacktivist groups will continue choosing U.S. targets for demonstrative cyber activity; however, most activity will not constitute a threat to security-conscious and well-resourced entities. We assess with moderate confidence that an increasing number of countries will demonstrate offensive cyber capabilities in the coming years. Based on the prominence of the cyber domain in modern economic and political competition and the growing presence of private companies offering offensive capabilities for sale, the number of U.S. cyber adversaries is liable to increase and diversify.

217	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that financially motivated cyber threat activity is very common and has a serious impact on individuals and organizations living or operating in Latin America and the Caribbean. We have observed a wide variety of cyber crime activity in the region, ranging from detections of widely distributed malware families to targeted ransomware deployment. During the past several years we have noted Brazilian cyber crime actors expanding the geographic scope of their targeting to include the Americas and Europe. We also observed evidence of increased collaboration between the Brazilian cyber crime community and those of other Latin American countries, including Mexico and Peru. Both trends could increase the threat posed by regional actors as they gain access to additional resources and expertise. We assess with moderate confidence that cyber espionage currently presents a low-frequency, moderate-impact threat to entities in Latin America. Foreign policy shifts may lead to increased cyber espionage campaigns.

218	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence identified evidence of more supply chain compromise incidents in 2021 than any year previously examined, though use of this tactic remains uncommon. Mandiant identified state-sponsored incidents likely intended to support strategic intelligence collection missions. We attribute most observed incidents to China. We noted an increase in financially motivated supply chain compromises, including incidents potentially leading to ransomware. For the first time in 2021, we identified more supply chain compromises involving developer tools or software dependencies than traditional software supply chain compromises, which typically target a final product. Following several impactful incidents and disclosures, government and technology organizations have taken steps and issued recommendations that we anticipate will increase the difficulty of software supply chain compromises in the medium to long term.

219	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that Chinese cyber espionage activity presents a high-frequency and intensity threat to a variety of transportation entities globally. Cyber espionage activity from other actors represents a moderate-frequency and intensity threat to the vertical. We believe that disruptive attacks, such as cyber physical manipulation and GPS spoofing and jamming, represent low-frequency but potentially catastrophic threats to the transportation industry. We assess with high confidence that cyber crime represents a high-frequency and intensity threat to the transportation sector. Threats include network compromise, ransomware, widely distributed malware, and airline ticket and reward program fraud. We judge that hacktivists remain a low-intensity and frequency threat to the transportation industry generally, although airports are attractive targets to hacktivists due to the significant publicity associated with attacks against them.

220	 Cyber crime is responsible for most attacks directed against hospitality companies. Cyber criminals use several methods to capitalize on a successful attack, theft of payment and sensitive data, and extortive attacks. The cyber espionage threat to the hospitality industry is dependent on the company's location and its political and social environment. Nation-state actors increasingly target the sector to collect information on hotel guests of interest, gather corporate information, and conduct destructive attacks. Hacktivism poses a minor threat to organizations in the hospitality industry. Targeting of entities in the hospitality sector primarily occurs opportunistically or as part of broader campaigns against multiple targets. The adaptation of internet of things (IoT) technology broadens the concerns about new cyber security risks.

221	 Financially motivated cyber threat activity poses a significant threat to the online gambling sector. Cyber criminals use several methods to capitalize on a successful attack, theft of payment, and sensitive data and extortive attacks. The cyber espionage threat to the online gambling industry is low. However, in 2017, North Korean actors conducted attacks against Central American casinos with the probable goal of extortion. Hacktivism poses a minor threat to the online gambling industry and is primarily opportunistic or comprises part of a broader campaign.

224	 The United Kingdom (UK) is a common target for espionage actors linked to a variety of countries. The types of organizations targeted are similar to other countries with a comparable level of international engagement and economic, military, and technological development. Given its position as a wealthy and technologically advanced nation, the UK is heavily affected by cyber crime campaigns, both those targeting the UK specifically and more broadly targeted campaigns affecting many other countries. The UK has been a target and source of hacktivist activity since at least 2011 and the growth and high-profile attacks by Anonymous-affiliated actors. While high-profile hacktivism attacks appear to have decreased in prevalence in recent years, the UK will likely continue to be a popular target for hacktivists with anti-UK, anti-establishment, and/or anti-Western motivations. While we have not confidently linked any espionage groups to the UK, the UK Government has publicly admitted to developing and maintaining an offensive cyber capability.

225	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that cyber espionage poses a frequent and serious threat to the technology industry. These operations likely target technology organizations to obtain proprietary data that could be used for military or commercial advantage, or to facilitate third-party and supply chain compromises. We assess with moderate confidence that financially motivated actors pose a significant, high-frequency threat to the technology industry. Common activity types include ransomware, theft of personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data, credential compromise, and sale of access to technology companies. Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that information operations are a nearly continuous but limited impact threat to social media organizations, primarily through credential theft, platform abuse, and reputation damage. These operations also likely pose an uncommon threat with negligible impact to other subsectors.

226	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that Russian cyber espionage operations presented a very common and serious threat to multiple industry sectors during late 2019 and 2020. Its operations are most frequently observed targeting governments in Russia's near abroad and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states, particularly Poland, Ukraine, and the U.S. Increased public exposure from primarily the U.S. and UK Governments provided unusual insight into these operations. Likewise, we assess with high confidence that Russian information operations present a very common and serious threat to countries and organizations in NATO and Russia's near abroad, particularly to media organizations and governments as well as nonprofit organizations, political parties, and international organizations. Mandiant assesses with high confidence that Russian-language cyber crime will continue to pose an almost continuous and serious threat to global organizations, with financially motivated activity from Russia targeting nearly every industry sector worldwide.

227	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that financially motivated cyber threat activity poses a frequent and high-impact threat to the healthcare sector due to the potential for the compromise of large volumes of highly sensitive personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information (PHI), financial data, and disruptive incidents, including ransomware infections. Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that cyber espionage activity poses an occasional threat to the healthcare sector, with past examples having a noticeable impact through compromise of sensitive data; however, future attacks could cause significant to catastrophic effects should actors undertake destructive or high-impact disruptive attacks. Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that information operations pose an occasional threat to the healthcare sector and can have a limited to noticeable impact on healthcare operations, particularly through influence of public opinion regarding efficacy and trustworthiness of healthcare providers and methods. Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that hacktivist campaigns are an uncommon threat to most organizations in the healthcare sector and may only have a negligible or minor impact on targeted organizations. We speculate that the lack of information technology (IT) security best practices in internet-connected medical devices, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and building management systems used by healthcare providers increases the risk profile due to the potential for significant negative consequences of a compromise.

248	 Key issues in the cyber crime threat landscape between January and March 2020 included account takeover, network compromises, ransomware operations, and operations including the use of mobile malware. Top malware detections between January and March 2020 included Emotet, LokiBot, FORMBOOK, NanoCore, and Ursnif. Through Q1 of 2020, Mandiant Threat Intelligence observed targeted threat activity associated with several named, financially motivated clusters, including FIN6, FIN7, FIN11, and TEMP.MetaStrike. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has become a highly exploited topic for malicious activity since the beginning of 2020, and threat actors with varying motivations are actively exploiting the current pandemic and public fear of COVID-19. We observed multiple phishing operations that exploited coronavirus-related themes throughout Q1 2020.

249	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that Russia will conduct additional destructive or disruptive cyber attacks connected to the crisis in Ukraine. Russian cyber attacks almost certainly will focus first on Ukraine, with Western/NATO allies also being possible targets. NATO and Western sanctions and responses likely will heavily influence Russia's perception of high-priority targets for retaliation, and Russian action may be focused against the financial industry, oil and gas sector, and media and entertainment. Organizations making statements condemning Russian aggression and/or supporting Ukraine and organizations taking actions to restrict Russian participation in international commerce, competitions, and events face elevated risk of future reprisal. We assess that Sandworm and UNC2589 are two of the most likely actors to conduct cyber attacks in retaliation, although we judge that all high-profile Russian threat actors will continue or increase cyber espionage to enhance decision advantage against Ukrainian and NATO government targets.

250	 UNC2589 is a cluster of cyber espionage activity active since at least early 2021 that has primarily targeted Ukraine, Georgia, and diplomatic and defense entities in Europe and North America. UNC2589 uses a handful of nonpublic and commercially available malware in its spear-phishing campaigns, and its command and control (C C) infrastructure shares commonalities. Mandiant has identified an additional UNC2589 destructive campaign leveraging the PAYWIPE and SHADYLOOK wiper malware as well as a suspected UNC2589 credential-stealing campaign using MARSSTEALER against Ukrainian government targets. This activity poses a threat to government, diplomatic, defense, pharmaceutical, and healthcare verticals globally, though particularly those in Ukraine and Georgia as well as North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and European Union (EU) member states.

251	 Further analysis of a recent UNC2589 campaign targeting Ukraine with SPRINGBEE malware has revealed new insights into UNC2589, including indications that UNC2589 is comprised of Russian-speaking actors. We additionally uncovered several historical UNC2589 phishing operations targeting U.S. and European Union (EU) government entities. This activity poses a threat to government and military entities and non-governmental (NGOs) worldwide, particularly those operating in or affiliated with Ukraine, Western Europe, and North America.

252	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that Russian state-sponsored cyber espionage continues to present a very common and serious threat to many industries, but particularly to governments worldwide. Russian cyber espionage operations overwhelmingly targeted the United States. We assess with high confidence that Russian-speaking cyber criminals will continue to pose an almost continuous and serious threat to global organizations, with financially motivated activity from Russia targeting nearly every industry sector worldwide. A growing number of extremely high-profile ransomware infections has begun to garner an increasing focus from national and international law enforcement organizations, as the disruption from these infections continues to rise. Pro-Russian information operations continue to target primarily NATO states, with a particular focus on nations in Russia's Near Abroad and the United States. These campaigns pose a moderate intensity and magnitude threat to targeted societies and governments. We observed few instances of genuine hacktivism based in Russia.

253	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the Russian Federation directs a series of sophisticated, long-standing cyber espionage programs that conduct threat activity and information operations globally against targets of interest to the Russian state. We have lower confidence in our attribution of some named groups to specific Russian security services due to Mandiant's lack of technical evidence associating many of these actor sets to their respective organizations. However, we draw on a wide body of open-source reporting on the mission mandates of Russian intelligence services and government attributions of specific actors to link threat groups we track to their likely sponsors. Attribution is a critical component of cyber threat intelligence because it provides insight into actor intent and helps analysts characterize current activity, anticipate future threats, and provide risk assessments to inform defensive strategies and resource allocation. We assess with high confidence that Russian-sponsored cyber threat groups represent an acute threat to governments, media and civil society organizations, and industrial control systems (ICS) in Eastern and Western Europe and North America.

254	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence identified fewer incidents in 2019 and 2020 than the previous peak of 2018, as of the time of writing; however, we suggest that the long-term trend continues to indicate growth. Espionage-motivated incidents eclipsed financially motivated supply chain compromises in 2020. Cases involving open-source software dependencies and developer tools represented nearly 40 percent of identified 2019 and 2020 supply chain compromises. Supply chain compromises targeting mobile apps and devices constituted 26 percent of cases identified in 2019 and 2020, up from 8 percent from 2013 2018.

255	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that cyber espionage poses a high-frequency threat to Southeast Asian entities and has a moderate to serious impact on affected organizations. Chinese groups are the most prolific in the region. We assess with high confidence that financially motivated cyber crime presents a high-frequency and moderate-intensity threat to Southeast Asia. Given the region's prominence and integration with major economies worldwide, we anticipate this level of activity will continue for at least the near to mid-term. Hacktivist activity has historically presented a low-frequency and -intensity threat to the region. However, we observed an uptick in hacktivist activity related to the February 2021 military coup in Myanmar that currently represents a moderate-intensity and -frequency threat to Myanmar and entities with business interests therein. We expect this activity will continue for at least the short term. We assess with moderate confidence that information operations currently represent a low-intensity and -frequency threat to the region.

257	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence suggests that the expedient implementation of emergency preparedness measures generates compounding benefits for organizations beyond the immediate goal of improving defenses against an imminent threat. In early 2020, Iranian general Qasem Soleimani's death in a U.S. airstrike led Mandiant to advise organizations to prepare for potential retaliatory Iranian cyber threat activity. Specifically, we suggested prioritizing detection of the initial stages of intrusions and implementing mitigations against commonly observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) Iranian espionage actors employ. Although we have not observed a dramatic increase in the frequency of Iranian operations or significant destructive operations targeting the U.S. or its allies as of July 2021, we suggest that organizations that implemented recommended countermeasures are not only better prepared to defend against potential Iranian activity, but they are also better prepared to counter threat activity from numerous additional threat actors who employ the same or similar TTPs. We expect that these TTPs will remain popular among diverse threat actors for at least the near to mid-term due to their proven effectiveness.

258	 Threat activity toward the government sector is primarily driven by the sensitive information contained at these agencies that can prove valuable for both state-sponsored and financially motivated threat actors. In 2020, this has included coronavirus treatment and response data. Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that state-sponsored threat actors frequently pose a severe threat to governments. We observed Russian, Chinese, Iranian, North Korean, Vietnamese, and Indian cyber espionage actors compromise governments. We assess with high confidence that cyber criminals regularly pose a moderate to severe threat to governments. In addition to FIN11, we have detected several UNC groups target national and regional government organizations with ransomware. We detected multiple information operations targeting governments, likely as a means to various geopolitical ends, including to undermine leaders, institutions, and adversaries, promote certain candidates for positions of power, delegitimize elections, or foment divisions amongst a populace. We assess with moderate confidence this threat activity poses a moderately frequent, severe threat to government organizations. Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that hacktivist groups regularly pose a low-impact risk to the government sector. We observed hacktivists conduct web defacements of government targets likely to protest policies or promote political ideologies.

259	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that state-sponsored activity typically represents a common, moderate-magnitude threat to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), with some incidents causing more serious impacts such as disruptive attacks. We observed Iranian activity most frequently, though we also documented operations from suspected Palestinian, Chinese, Russian, and United Arab Emirates (UAE) actors affecting GCC public and private targets. We assess with moderate confidence that GCC organizations face a regular-frequency, moderate- to serious-intensity threat from financially motivated cyber threat activity. We observed a number of initial access clusters active in the region as well as evidence of ransomware affecting a broad range of industries. Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that information operations pose a continuous but typically limited intensity threat to the GCC. We most frequently observe activity that appears to be supportive of Iranian interests, though we have also observed additional activity, for instance, a campaign likely supporting UAE interests. We believe that hacktivism presents a semi-regular but ultimately limited impact threat to GCC entities, though significant events may trigger increased activity. We also note that low-sophistication targeting of operational technology (OT) systems could affect GCC countries in the future as we see this type of activity increasing both globally and in Iran and Israel.

260	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that state-sponsored activity poses a regular-frequency, moderate-intensity threat to the United Kingdom. The geopolitical and economic significance of the nation makes it an attractive target for state-sponsored threats seeking strategic intelligence to support their military, pollical, and economic objectives. We judge that information operations continue to pose a moderate-frequency, moderate-severity threat to the UK, and we have detected inauthentic coordinated social media networks supporting various state interests, including those of Russia and Iran. Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that financially motivated threat activity poses a high-frequency, serious-intensity threat to the UK, and we continue to observe threat actors leverage ransomware and phishing sites as part of their campaigns. Hacktivists pose a rare, low-severity threat to the UK; however, notable events can potentially motivate these threats to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and data leaks, if provoked.

265	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that cyber espionage poses a frequent and serious threat to the technology industry. These operations likely target technology organizations to obtain proprietary data that could be used for military or commercial advantage, or to facilitate third-party and supply chain compromises. We assess with moderate confidence that financially motivated actors pose a significant, high-frequency threat to the technology industry. Common activity types include ransomware, theft of personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data, credential compromise, and sale of access to technology companies. Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that information operations are a nearly continuous but limited impact threat to social media organizations, primarily through credential theft, platform abuse, and reputation damage. These operations also likely pose an uncommon threat with negligible impact to other subsectors.

267	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that exchanges and investment services face a constant, high-intensity threat from financially motivated cyber threat activity. Mandiant assesses with high confidence that state-sponsored activity represents a moderate-frequency, serious-intensity threat to investment services and exchanges. From February 2020 to September 2021, North Korean operators demonstrated the most focused interest on investment services and exchanges and were observed more frequently than other actors. We also noted Chinese, Iranian, and Russian activity. We assess with moderate confidence that hacktivism occasionally affects investment services organizations and exchanges with limited impact. Mandiant Threat Intelligence speculates that influence campaigns and coordinated inauthentic social media activity targeting investment services or exchanges could be used to create economic disruptions in target countries.

268	 UNC2452 practices a high degree of operational security (OPSEC) by using multiple, varied techniques to evade detection in different parts of the attack life cycle and protect high-valued tools, such as SUNBURST . Key OPSEC techniques for the group include blending in with victims' Ã¢â¬Â¯ environments by operating within local business hours, tailoring actions to the victim environment, and detecting and disabling security features. We assess that UNC2452 will continue to pursue tactics tailored to victim environments in order to avoid detection and may continue to pursue higher levels of OPSEC to target victims where means for compromising additional victims can be pursued.

269	 Mandiant Threat Intelligence attribution analysis linked UNC2452 activity seen in 2020 and 2021 to previously observed compromises dating back to as early as 2018. Timeline analysis of UNC2452's activity highlighted notable shifts in its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including changes to techniques for initial entry and accessing mailboxes, which the group has continued to modify after the 2020 disclosure of SUNBURST activity. Supporting attribution work identified key overlaps between current and earlier activities based on victimology, email targeting, a light malware footprint, and novel TTPs, such as SAML token abuse, hijacking Azure AD applications, service principal manipulations, and mailbox permission modifications. Expanding UNC2452's timeline of activity provides researchers and network defenders additional TTPs and targeting information when trying to prevent or remediate breaches from this aggressive threat group.

270	 UNC2452 is a highly sophisticated Russian cyber espionage group active since 2018 that poses a substantial risk to Western governments, policy organizations focused on Russia, and IT services organizations, as the group frequently targets sensitive victim data, including emails and SharePoint files. UNC2452 is well-resourced and conducted multiple, large-scale compromises simultaneously in different time zones throughout 2020 and 2021. The group shares several overlaps with other Russian espionage groups, including APT29, such as targeting, heightened operational security, and a reliance on BEACON variants. We are also tracking possibly related activity involving phishing and targeting cloud service providers, that we assess may be related to UNC2452 based on varying degrees of general overlaps. We assess that UNC2452 will continue to operate at a significant operational tempo going forward, finding creative ways to access its targets, including leveraging trust relationships to target third parties.

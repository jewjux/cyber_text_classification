Initial Access: T1189 Drive-by Compromise,"Currently, the group operates in two major business segments: Operation Daybreak and Operation Erebus. The first, Operation Daybreak, appears to have been launched by ScarCruft in March 2016 and uses a previously unknown (0-day) Adobe Flash Player exploit that targets high-profile victims. The other, ""Operation Erebus"", uses an older exploit for CVE-2016-4117 and employs watering holes.

This technique soon became popular among crooks and scammers, who took the advantage of these services to conceal their malicious links and pass it on like genuine links to various users. Couple this obfuscation trick with a neatly worded email that will convince any user of its ""genuineness"" in no time."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"Once Emotet infects a system, it steals names and email addresses from victims' contact lists and uses them to send phishing emails to other victims."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,The threat was frequently spread via phishing emails packed with malicious documents or links.
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"Shortened URLs are especially handy when using Twitter, which limits tweets to 140 characters, because some URLs would consume the entire message. They're perfect for including in emails that solicit the user to click on a link that leads them to a malicious site (drive-by download, phishing site, scam). The text of the email message is often designed to fool the user into thinking the link is trustworthy since they see so many links come in this way. A common trick is to imitate an email from the IT department to get users to click on a link to change their password, which leads to a site that steals their password."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"What makes Emotet especially troubling is the way it uses social engineering and personal and professional relationships to spread, Cisco Talos said in its report on the recent attacks against .mil and .gov targets. Because Emotet uses a victim's contact list to send itself to other people, a person receiving the email can be lured into believing it is safe. Sometimes the message that Emotet sends includes the contents of a previous email exchange between the victim and the recipient, further adding to its apparent authenticity, Cisco Talos said."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,The new EMOTET variants often are sent via phishing emails claiming to be an invoice or payment notification with the body of the email containing a malicious URL. Clicking the link will download a document containing malicious macros designed to execute a PowerShell command line responsible for downloading the trojan.
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"The initial infection vectors are Office documents or JavaScript files. These are often placed on compromised webservers (which are then spammed out to potential victims) or directly attached to the spam email (email attachment). Sometimes, Emotet uses information stolen from Outlook email boxes to distribute further and to have credible sender addresses and subject lines (email thread hijacking)."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"Additionally, as a mode of self-propagation, Emotet can access a victim's inbox and reply to the various unread emails contained within, using content stolen from the unread emails to impersonate the original victim. These reply emails are delivered via a network of stolen outbound SMTP accounts, all in an attempt to trick the victim's email contacts into opening up a malicious attachment and become infected themselves, explains Cisco Talos in a blog post report today."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"Initially, ransomware groups that leverage SystemBC have been observed first infecting systems using spam or phishing emails. These emails then trick the victim into downloading the Buer loader, QBot, ZLoader or other types of malware, which are used for initial exploitation and lateral movement."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"The attackers behind the attack leveraged hundreds of compromised, legitimate email accounts in order to target organizations with emails, which pretended to be document delivery notifications. In reality, the phishing attack stole victims' Office 365 credentials."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"As well as brute forcing passwords, Emotet can also spread to additional computers using a spam module that it installs on infected victim machines. This module generates emails that use standard social engineering techniques and typically contain subject lines including words such as ""Invoice"". Some subject lines include the name of the person whose email account has been compromised, to make it seem less like a spam email. The emails typically contain a malicious link or attachment which if launched will result in them becoming infected with Trojan.Emotet."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,Emotet gets an initial foothold on a victim machine or network by sending an email containing either a malicious link that leads to a downloader document or that has a malicious document attached.
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"Emotet is an advanced Trojan primarily spread via phishing email attachments and links that, once clicked, launch the payload."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,This group of attackers favors using URL shortening services to disguise the true links they are sending in spear phishing emails.

Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"The APT28 campaign uses spearphishing emails to target victims, as well as malicious websites doctored to appear as legitimate news and politics websites."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"The botnet works by spamming targets with emails perpetrating to be business-related communications. These emails either contain a malicious Office document, or a link to a malicious Office file that users are told to download on their PCs."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"The encoded URI will be long and forbidding looking, but assuming it doesn't exceed the maximum URL length of a browser, it can be rendered. And, Klevjer's paper points out, the widespread use of URL shortening services makes it easy for the attacker to mask the hefty URL and circulate it to victims via social networks like Twitter and Facebook, or via e-mail and IM."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"Attackers use several techniques to hide the real link destination, including URL shorteners, sometimes strung together to make it even more difficult to see the ultimate destination. They also use redirectors on compromised sites that have a legitimate-looking URL but which then send the victim to another malicious site."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"Emotet typically arrives in malicious email attachments, and an outbreak often starts like this:."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"As recently as early July, officials in Portsmouth, New Hampshire said that the Emotet malware cost them $156,000 to remove after spreading to the city's entire computer network via phishing emails."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"Some of these emails contain malicious attachments, packed into their archives; others have no attachments, but with message text designed to lure users into links that lead to external resources, and then downloading malicious objects from those resources."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"The resurgence also continues one of Emotet's most devious email-based self-propagation methods, according to Cisco Talos researchers Colin Grady, William Largent and Jaeson Schultz. The trojan accesses old email messages in a victim's inbox and replies to them, thus jumping into the middle of an existing email conversation. Purporting to be a legitimate correspondent, it sends along a malicious attachment."
Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,Emotet has returned after a five-month hiatus. Researchers first spotted the malware in a campaign that has spammed Microsoft Office users with hundreds of thousands of malicious emails since Friday.

Initial Access: T1566 Phishing,"Emotet was last seen in February 2020, in a campaign that sent SMS messages purporting to be from victims' banks. Once victims clicked on the links in the text messages, they are asked to hand over their banking credentials and download a file that infects their systems with the Emotet malware."

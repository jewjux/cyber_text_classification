" Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that Russia will conduct additional destructive or disruptive cyber attacks connected to the crisis in Ukraine. Russian cyber attacks almost certainly will focus first on Ukraine, with Western/NATO allies also being possible targets. NATO and Western sanctions and responses likely will heavily influence Russia's perception of high-priority targets for retaliation, and Russian action may be focused against the financial industry, oil and gas sector, and media and entertainment. Organizations making statements condemning Russian aggression and/or supporting Ukraine and organizations taking actions to restrict Russian participation in international commerce, competitions, and events face elevated risk of future reprisal. We assess that Sandworm and UNC2589 are two of the most likely actors to conduct cyber attacks in retaliation, although we judge that all high-profile Russian threat actors will continue or increase cyber espionage to enhance decision advantage against Ukrainian and NATO government targets.

" The cyber espionage threat to the manufacturing industry is very high. Cyber espionage activity targeting the manufacturing industry may target proprietary business data and valuable intellectual property, executive communications, and business plans to benefit domestic competitors, or it could serve as reconnaissance for a disruptive attack. The cyber crime threat to the sector is medium. The industry is not heavily targeted by cyber criminals. However, widespread, indiscriminate malware campaigns, such as ransomware and credential theft, can still affect company networks; phishing and exploit kits are common infection vectors. Although the possibility of being targeted by ransomware is not high, once infected, the impact for the company can be severe. The hacktivist threat to companies in the manufacturing industry is low. While several hacktivist groups have conducted campaigns that tangentially target the sector, they lacked significant impact. The manufacturing industry's increasing adoption of industrial control system (ICS) equipment, combined with attackers' increasing capabilities against ICS, will increase the long-term risk to the manufacturing industry.

" By the end of 2021, Mandiant identified more zero-days exploited in the wild than double the previous record volume in 2019. Led by Chinese groups, state-sponsored groups continue to be the primary actors exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. The proportion of financially motivated actors, particularly ransomware groups, deploying zero-day exploits has been steadily increasing since 2013. Threat actors exploited zero-days in Microsoft, Apple, and Google products most frequently, likely reflecting the popularity of these vendors. The vast increase in zero-day exploitation in 2021, as well as the diversification of actors using them, expands the risk portfolio for organizations in nearly every industry sector and geography, particularly those that rely on these popular systems.

" On July 13, 2019, an alleged hacktivist called 0V1ru$ ( @0v1ruS ) claimed to have compromised Russian company SyTech, a suspected Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) contractor, sharing purportedly stolen data online. We assess with moderate confidence that the leaked materials are legitimate. We suggest that the leaked documents provide valuable insight into Russian government signals intelligence (SIGINT) and cyber espionage capabilities as well as the extent of integration between government organizations and private contractors. The projects described suggest well-resourced efforts to collect intelligence and perform reconnaissance for future cyber espionage and information operations. Cyber espionage actors believed to be associated with the FSB and potentially supported by these programs include APT29, Turla, and TEMP.Isotope.

" Mandiant Threat Intelligence is monitoring the escalating tension between Ukraine and Russia and looking for reflections of increased cyber threat activity from Russian state-sponsored actors as a result. Sandworm probably poses the greatest and most likely threat to Ukraine, based on its historical cyber attacks on Ukraine and its apparent mandate for disruptive and destructive operations. Sandworm is sponsored by Russian military intelligence and would almost certainly support Russian military operations in Ukraine in some capacity. We may also see an uptick in cyber espionage operations from APT28, also sponsored by Russian military intelligence, or TEMP.Armageddon and TEMP.Vermin actors whose previous targeting since inception is near exclusively against Ukrainian government targets. TEMP.Isotope has regularly targeted Ukrainian government and energy entities in the past, but it likely poses a lower threat than the previous groups in this current environment.

Based on current observations, Turla has demonstrated the broadest portfolio of tactics, followed by APT28, and APT29. We observed Russian state-sponsored actors use many defense evasion tactics as well as command and control (C C), discovery and persistence, though this distribution is likely at least partially influenced by the overall quantity of tactics in each category.

" Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the upcoming Zapad-2021 military exercise will drive additional cyber espionage leading up to and during the event from multiple countries seeking insight into capabilities and intentions of participants and reactions among neighboring countries. We expect defense and government organizations will be most heavily targeted. U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military units should remain alert for the potential intensification of information operations during Zapad and other military exercises. Anti-NATO and anti-U.S. military narratives are common themes for several information operations campaigns we track, which target the Baltic states, Poland, and Ukraine. Despite ongoing and recently increased Chinese-Russian military cooperation, we expect both countries to continue cyber espionage against the other's defense and military targets for the foreseeable future.

" Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the Russian Federation directs a series of sophisticated, long-standing cyber espionage programs that conduct threat activity and information operations globally against targets of interest to the Russian state. We have lower confidence in our attribution of some named groups to specific Russian security services due to Mandiant's lack of technical evidence associating many of these actor sets to their respective organizations. However, we draw on a wide body of open-source reporting on the mission mandates of Russian intelligence services and government attributions of specific actors to link threat groups we track to their likely sponsors. Attribution is a critical component of cyber threat intelligence because it provides insight into actor intent and helps analysts characterize current activity, anticipate future threats, and provide risk assessments to inform defensive strategies and resource allocation. We assess with high confidence that Russian-sponsored cyber threat groups represent an acute threat to governments, media and civil society organizations, and industrial control systems (ICS) in Eastern and Western Europe and North America.

 Sophisticated threat actors used watering holes and spear phishing to target industrial engineers. Such engineers are high-value targets due to their access to sensitive information and industrial processes. Targeting of engineers has been used in the past as a foothold to industrial control systems (ICS) networks.

" The three primary Russian intelligence services the Federal Security Service (FSB), Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU) have exhibited divergent organizational cultures that subsequently affect how their personnel carry out operations. Media and government attribution of specific clusters of activity to different Russian intelligence services can be leveraged as an analytic lens to draw parallels between the organizational cultures of alleged sponsors and the tradecraft of certain associated threat actors. This type of analysis offers potential insight into the possible future activities by Russia-nexus threat actors like Sandworm Team and TEMP.Isotope. ",['No ttp provided'],TEMP.Isotope

" On May 3, 2018, the German newspaper S ddeutsche Zeitung ( SZ ) reported previously undisclosed intrusions into the networks of at least two German energy providers during summer 2017. On May 8, 2018, SZ revealedthat Netcom BW, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and subsidiary of the German power company EnBW, also suffered a series of intrusions that began in May 2017. It is not clear if the intrusion into Netcom BW was one of the earlier reported intrusions. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has moderate confidence that the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed in the earlier reported intrusions mirror those of Russian-nexus threat actor TEMP.Isotope. We believe that the Netcom BW intrusion is likely related to Russian-nexus activity targeting network infrastructure devices that we have not been able to attribute to TEMP.Isotope, but was described in a recent joint U.S.-UK alert.

" Symantec's recent public report characterizes TEMP.Isotope activity as a resurgence of Koala Team activity, predominantly targeting industrial control systems (ICS) with a variety of tactics. While we concur with Symantec that TEMP.Isotope activity likely represents a more sophisticated actor using commonly available malware to cast doubt on attribution, we disagree that some of the activity highlighted by Symantec originates from TEMP.Isotope. Regardless of attribution, we anticipate TEMP.Isotope will continue to pose a significant risk to the energy sector using publicly available tools.

"TEMP.Isotope, active since at least 2015, is a suspected Russia-nexus cyber espionage threat actor that targets the global energy and manufacturing sectors and Middle Eastern organizations. Although the group has been publicly linked to the Russia-nexus Koala Team, we have not linked the activities of TEMP.Isotope to any known actors. This actor has engaged in a credential theft campaign from late-2015 by leveraging malicious documents and strategic web compromises against entities in the energy and government sectors. The documents and strategic web compromises were designed to target individuals in engineering roles. Significantly, the group has emphasized targeting of individuals working with industrial control systems (ICS), raising the possibility the activity is preparation for attack.",['No ttp provided'],TEMP.Isotope
" From January 2019 to June 2021, Mandiant Threat Intelligence observed evidence of at least eight espionage clusters linked to Iran, China, and Russia, as well as operations deploying at least 10 different ransomware families, exploit 20 specific vulnerabilities in VPN software from seven different vendors. CVE-2019-19781, CVE-2019-11510, and CVE-2018-13379 were exploited by the largest number of separate activity clusters, at least 13, 12, and 10, respectively. Suspected APT5 and UNC757 were the most prolific actors, exploiting six and five VPN vulnerabilities, respectively. We continued to observe new reports of exploitation of most of these vulnerabilities well after the initial waves of disclosures and exploitations, indicating that delays in patching compound the risk that unpatched or unmitigated software will be exploited. We assess with moderate confidence that the primary driver behind VPN exploitation remains the unique, powerful, and efficient utility of a flaw in a VPN gateway to accomplish a variety of attacker goals.

" The number of zero-days exploited as of July 2021 is on track to more than double the previous record volume from 2019 and has already surpassed all previous years on record. State-sponsored groups continue to be the primary actors exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, although the proportion of financially motivated actors deploying zero-day exploits has grown significantly since 2019. Microsoft's Exchange and Windows Server software, Apple's iOS, and Google's Chrome browser had the highest volume of zero-days exploited by threat actors, likely reflecting the popularity of these products.

" Mandiant Threat Intelligence judges that the common exploitation of Microsoft Windows vulnerabilities reflects widespread use of this operating system and the efficacy of Microsoft Office documents as an initial infection vector. Mandiant documented a dramatic increase in zero-day exploitation in 2021. We also observed numerous significant campaigns in which threat actors exploited vulnerabilities in VPNs as a means to gain initial access to victim networks. Patterns in frequently exploited software have shifted in 2020 and 2021 with threat actors exploiting products, such as VPN technologies and file transfer applications, which have not historically been among the most frequently exploited products. Mobile vulnerability exploitation also appears to have increased. Chinese, Russian, and Iranian state-sponsored actors continue to exploit vulnerabilities as part of their campaigns.

" FireEye Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the cyber espionage threat to national governments is severe. Nation-state threat actors frequently target other governments to gain access to political, diplomatic, economic, and military intelligence. We assess with moderate confidence that the information operations threat to national governments is high. Nation-states increasingly engage in information operations meant to affect government policies, influence national elections, and undermine public confidence in national institutions. FireEye Intelligence judges that hacktivism typically presents a frequent but limited impact threat to well-patched national government systems. However, prominent government websites have been successfully targeted by hacktivists in recent years. We assess with moderate confidence that financially motivated activity presents a moderate threat to well-patched national government systems as criminal actors commonly target vulnerable government databases to gain access to personally identifiable information (PII).

Notable tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) include spearphishing, use of remote access trojans (RATs), router exploitation, and password spraying. We assess with moderate confidence that disruptive and destructive threats from nation-state actors, such as Russia and Iran, pose an elevated risk to oil and gas firms, as groups attributed to these countries have staged operations against these sectors in the past and have enduring geopolitical and economic interests that could spur future activity. We are highly confident that financially motivated activity poses a moderate-frequency, moderate-intensity threat to the oil and gas sector.

" Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that Russia aims to interfere in democratic processes to generate conditions favorable to its strategic objectives (e.g., to undermine confidence in adversary democratic governments domestically and internationally and to exacerbate existing societal divisions among target populations). We have observed multiple incidents in which Russian threat actors have attempted to directly interfere with core or auxiliary infrastructure ahead of national elections in multiple countries. Past incidents include network-scanning activity, database compromise, spearphishing, and attempted disruptive/destructive attacks. Common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in pro-Russian information operations related to elections include amplification of organic and fabricated content using social media, hack and leak operations, and the use of false hacktivist personas as well as disruption and compromise of media channels. In addition to espionage that takes place in the lead-up to elections, ongoing espionage activity may attempt to support hack-and-leak operations in the future, collect compromised credentials for later operations, and provide data for traditional intelligence missions. We assess with high confidence that Russia will continue attempting to interfere with democratic processes globally, relying heavily on information operations. We also expect that Russian espionage actors will continue to target core and auxiliary election entities, especially as voting systems and other processes become increasingly virtualized.

" FireEye Intelligence continues to observe state-sponsored and other threat actors target national elections to collect intelligence and exert influence as well as attempt to delegitimize or disrupt the electoral process. We assess with high confidence that actors will persist in targeting entities associated with elections. Based on activity observed from 2016 2019, we believe that threat actors have focused their targeting against electoral platforms affecting public opinion, such as news organizations, political parties, and other entities with comparatively larger attack surfaces than core election systems. While we have observed one credible instance of a core elections system being successfully compromised, we have not observed evidence of any instances that resulted in alteration or manipulation of votes .

" We assess with high confidence that Russian and Chinese espionage actors consistently pose a high-frequency, high-impact threat to U.S. entities. Future targets are likely to include entities connected to the upcoming U.S. election and entities involved in defense, diplomacy, and/or policymaking. Iran and North Korea also pose a potentially destructive threat based on current geopolitical tensions and past activity. Information operations that support Russian or Iranian interests pose a high-frequency, moderate-impact threat. We have also observed campaigns targeting the U.S. that do not appear to support state interests and at least one campaign that may have been orchestrated by a marketing firm in support of a third party that appeared to support state interests. We assess with high confidence that the U.S. will remain a high-frequency target of both targeted and opportunistic financially motivated cyber activity for the foreseeable future. Operations range from low to high impact. We assess with moderate confidence that the perceived lucrative nature of high-impact operations, such as targeted ransomware infections, may cause additional actors to adopt these tactics. We assess with moderate confidence that hacktivist groups will continue choosing U.S. targets for demonstrative cyber activity; however, most activity will not constitute a threat to security-conscious and well-resourced entities. We assess with moderate confidence that an increasing number of countries will demonstrate offensive cyber capabilities in the coming years. Based on the prominence of the cyber domain in modern economic and political competition and the growing presence of private companies offering offensive capabilities for sale, the number of U.S. cyber adversaries is liable to increase and diversify.

" Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that financially motivated activity, particularly ransomware, will represent a very common and moderate-magnitude threat to the hospitality sector in the future, barring any significant changes to the threat landscape. Although we identified several notable cyber espionage actors targeting the hospitality sector, the threat from these groups is significantly lower than that from financially motivated actors. We assess with moderate confidence that cyber espionage actors overall pose an occasional and limited-magnitude threat to the hospitality sector. Cyber espionage actors primarily target hospitality businesses to harvest information on targeted guests, almost certainly to enable additional intelligence collection. The onset of the global coronavirus pandemic drastically affected the hospitality sector, forcing many organizations to radically alter their business models.

" Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that state-sponsored cyber espionage activity poses a regular frequency, moderate intensity threat to the media and entertainment industry. We judge that information operations pose a persistent, serious threat to the sector. By nature, information operations seek to mimic, leverage, and manipulate legitimate media and entertainment platforms, practitioners, and consumers in order to deliver messages to diverse audiences. Mandiant believes that financially motivated activity poses a very common, moderate intensity threat to the media and entertainment sector.

Financially motivated threat activity is almost certainly a near-constant threat to a wide variety of organizations and individuals in Israel, though in many cases it is likely relatively low impact particularly if security best standards are followed. FireEye Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that the threat to Israeli organizations and individuals from cyber crime is largely similar to that faced by entities in other developed nations. Israel is a common target for hacktivist campaigns, and multiple hacktivist actors and groups routinely target Israeli entities. As many of these campaigns are motivated by pro-Palestine, pro-Islam, and anti-Israel sentiment, all of which are related to persistent geopolitical and religious tensions in the region and globally, FireEye Intelligence expects that hacktivism targeting Israel will continue for the foreseeable future. FireEye Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that foreign information operations represent a growing threat to Israel, both from campaigns attempting to manipulate domestic opinions and internationally targeted campaigns attempting to foster anti-Israel sentiments.

Espionage actors may target energy and utility entities in order to defend their economic interests by seeking information related to business operations, new processes and technologies, and mergers and acquisitions; they may also seek to target entities in these categories that constitute critical infrastructure for military or political advantage. We believe the energy and utilities sectors are at increased risk of disruptive and destructive threats, particularly from nation-state actors from Russia and Iran, who have demonstrated the capabilities and intent to conduct such attacks. We assess with high confidence that financially motivated threat activity poses a moderate-frequency, moderate-intensity threat to energy and utility companies. Disruptive financial threats, such as ransomware, pose a notable threat to critical infrastructure operations. Key threat drivers include efforts by nation-states to maintain regional and global trade dominance, develop sources of new energy, and undertake significant energy sector projects; threats are also likely affected by geopolitical tensions between Western nations, Russia, the Middle East, and other regions highly active in the energy sector.

" Russian cyber operations in the Middle East will likely continue to focus on espionage against regional government, military, energy, and science and technology targets. Russia may also combine its espionage activities with false-front hacktivism mainly targeting defense and media pursuant to Moscow's hybrid warfare strategy. Under this strategy, Moscow uses a blend of conventional arms, special operations forces, and cyber activities to achieve foreign policy goals while deliberately blurring the line between war and peacetime through aggressive operations that, individually, are not serious enough to provoke a full military response. Russia may seek information pertaining to regional armed conflicts, energy production, the political and military activities of the U.S. and its allies, defense-related science and technology, and protection of Russian assets.

" Mandiant incident response investigations and open-source information demonstrate that UNC2452, UNC2652, and likely related activity clusters pursued multiple third-party compromises in 2020 and 2021. Third-party compromises afford tactical and operational advantages to attackers compared to direct targeting. A single compromise can facilitate access to multiple potential targets, and victims may be less likely to detect an intrusion that abuses a trusted channel.

China's activities also affect Japan, South Korea, Israel, India, Russia, and Taiwan. Russia-based actors conduct espionage for strategic and tactical intelligence, often in conjunction with regional conflicts such as the incursion into Ukraine and Syria, and have also targeted the U.S., North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) elements, and European defense expos. We observed Iran targeting the U.S. likely to improve domestic military capabilities, gain insights into the disposition of the U.S. military or the U.S. alliance with Israel, and to obtain information allowing for the destruction or degradation of information and operations. We suspect North Korea targets U.S. assets in South Korea and regional military elements for strategic information and to plan for destruction and degradation of U.S. and South Korean defense. India and Pakistan-based operations have targeted DIB organizations, including peripheral targets in the U.S. military. Hacktivism affects the DIB primarily through low-impact disruption or data disclosure attacks , often in regions including the U.S., Turkey, and Israel.

"[' ACTION DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE MITIGATION Using Public Networks Malicious actors can sit on the same network and monitor unencrypted information coming to and from a computer. Sometimes they can set up on their own network and disguise it as a legitimate one to collect even more information. The Fallout Team , a cyber espionage team with a South Korea-nexus, has compromised business travelers through malicious spoofed software updates delivered via hotel Wi-Fi networks. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your Internet traffic from your computer to the end destination. Do not click to update software when on a shared public network. Using a Guessable Password If hackers knew your computer username and password and if the firewall allowed for remote log ins, they could remotely access your computer. During the Qatar National Bank (QNB) breach in April 2016, attackers likely obtained legitimate credentials from a SQL injection attack and used them to access the FileShare System. Use strong passwords. Change passwords often and as soon as possible after a breach. Use a different password for each online account. Use two-factor authentication. Inserting a Disk or USB Hackers can easily modify read-write disks and USB drives to infect computers with malware and spread malware from computer to computer. Read-only CDs or DVDs also can have malware, but are a lower threat. In October 2016, actor qpalzm01 advertised the Blackmail Bitcoin Ransomware 2016 , highlighting a distribution tactic involving USB drives which could allow for more targeted ransomware attacks. Avoid inserting disks or USBs of unknown origin or ones that could have been used in less secure computers. If files need transferred from such devices, transfer them to a stand-alone system first with no sensitive data to scan for viruses. Charging a Phone on a Computer Malicious actors can infect a phone through apps or downloads, for example, and then can infect a computer once the phone is plugged into it, since charging a phone on a computer essentially turns the phone into a USB. The Hamweq.A worm spread via removable USB drives and used smartphones as a carrier when connected to a Windows PC. Charge a phone in a portable USB charger or an outlet, or via a USB condom that blocks data transfer to and from the phone. ACTION DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE MITIGATION Running Outdated Software Hackers use various tools to scan for outdated or unpatched software, like operating systems, browsers, or plug-ins. Companies often stop updating software at all after a certain point, so known vulnerabilities would remain. Microsoft announced in January 2017 that it will discontinue security updates to Windows 7 in January 2020 unless customers pay for customized support. Make sure your software is still supported, and preferably the newest version. Update software automatically. Visiting a Webpage Hackers can conduct a drive-by download by submitting malicious advertisements even to popular, legitimate websites. These ads automatically redirect visitors to a malicious, sometimes invisible, website that identifies and exploits any Internet browser vulnerabilities the visitor might have without visitors even needing to click on the ad. In late 2015, the Forbes website unknowingly had malicious ads that infected some visitors computers. Koala Team , which focuses on energy, academia, and pharmaceutical sectors, uses waterhole attacks against targets, where it infects a website targeted employees would probably visit. Have updated anti-virus protection. Browse the Internet in an account without administrator privileges or use a virtual machine. Change your browser preferences to block ads and scripts. Do not consent when a website wants you to install plugins or extensions. Downloading Software Online Malicious actors can bundle software, music, or movies online with malware. The Qtipr.com browser hijacker , which constantly displays popup ads, can unknowingly be installed when users download free videos, files, and software from questionable websites. Download only at reputable sites. Be suspicious of free downloads. Have up-to-date anti-virus software. ACTION DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE MITIGATION Clicking on a Link Malicious actors can direct hyperlinks to a website that automatically launches malware or that is designed to capture log-in credentials, even if the link looks like it goes to a legitimate website. Malicious actors can also link to a picture that launches malware once the picture loads. As of November 2016, FireEye detected unidentified threat actors sending emails with shortened bit.ly links that redirected targets to websites with malicious .RAR archives that would download the WHITEWALK backdoor on victims computers. Do not click on links or load unexpected photos from emails. Make sure your email provider does not allow scripts to run in emails. Type in or search for the home page address of popular websites instead. Opening an Email Attachment Hackers can disguise malicious executable files as pictures, documents, pdfs, etc. so you cannot just rely on the file name to determine if a file is safe. Hackers can also spoof the from address, so the email may appear to come from a friend. In August 2016, APT29 sent out phishing emails with attachments to targets in organizations that worked closely with US and European governments. The two spoofed from addresses were real think tank employees. Check with the sender before opening attachments you do not expect. If you must open an unverified attachment, do so on a fully backed-up computer to minimize the repercussions in case it is malicious. ']",['No ttp provided'],APT29
" Ukraine is a primary target of pro-Russian cyber espionage entities .

" Hackers attempt to compromise cloud services to scale their computing capabilities and improve their anonymity. In 2016, cloud storage ranked among the most phished industry, and researchers have stated that there is a strong possibility that cloud storage services will be the most targeted industry in 2017. Malicious hackers and malware are known to permanently delete cloud data, which is done for several reasons, ranging from covering their tracks to harming the business. Organizations using multi-factor authentication and integrating user permissions in their systems have fared much better when targeted by persistent cyber threats. Most of the data breaches we investigate happen due to weak passwords, sloppy authentication, or poor certificate and key management. The auto sync technology in cloud services may allow malicious software installed on one of the machines to spread to other machines and networks. Account hijacking enables attackers to modify data, plant malware, manipulate transactions, or launch other attacks from affected cloud-based accounts. Organizations use application programming interfaces (APIs) to connect to cloud services and applications, making them the most exposed part of the system. Resources on the cloud may be shared between several organizations or different parts of organizations, so vulnerabilities may pose a bigger problem in the cloud computing environment. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against cloud providers are usually conducted to extort money from customers or the provider and can also make the asset unavailable.

" Cyber espionage is a significant threat to finance. The finance industry has seen a much higher than average use of watering holes (i.e., compromised third-party websites trusted by members of the finance industry) that attackers use to deliver malware and profile targets while appearing to deliver legitimate traffic. Most activity targeting the sector is likely Chinese and motivated by supporting key industries for economic advantage. However, Iran also targets the West and Middle East to gain leverage in its geopolitical conflicts. Additionally, Russia targets the West for data theft, probably to support intelligence targeting or to prepare for attacks on the finance industry as part of political conflicts, rather than for financial gain, and North Korea routinely targets South Korea for strategic asset compromise. Cyber crime is the greatest threat to finance. Victims include a wide range of organizations including banks, investment services, and insurance companies. Developing trends in cyber crime include increases in attempted and successful exploitations of banks' client-side Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) connections; exploitation of the Europay, MasterCard, and Visa (EMV) chip protocol; use of mobile malware to bypass multi-factor authentication; and continuing actor interest in ATM fraud. Hacktivism, though common, poses little threat to the financial sector . Generally, hacktivism operations pose a low risk to targets, as most hacktivist activity takes the form of website defacements, social media campaigns, and DDoS attacks, which have caused some harm through loss of customer access, but are typically short in duration. Nation-states seeking to damage the finance industry, especially Russia, could pose as hacktivists when conducting attacks or releasing embarrassing documents to the public. We are observing a changing threat landscape facing the financial industry in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. China-based cyber crime operations are expanding geographically and are increasingly targeting Japanese organizations, particularly smaller institutions with weak security measures, for credential theft and money laundering. Russia may be increasingly threatened by domestic actors and insider threats. Latin America faces increasing insider threat activity, notably in Mexico, and credit card compromise.

" Executive Summary Cyber espionage operations from Russia are highly active and are conducting aggressive campaigns against targets in line with Russian strategic and tactical interests. Russian information operations are actively used to influence foreign elections, political processes, and opinions regarding various issues ; observed examples of these campaigns include operations masquerading as pro-Islamic State hacktivist groups, anti-establishment hacktivist groups, news agencies, and political organizations. These campaigns were active in attempting to influence the global narrative around events such as the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and the 2016 Olympic Games. Cyber crime operations conducted by Russian actors remain a significant threat to many organizations, particularly in Western countries, and this activity has affected organizations ranging in size from small local financial organizations to large multinational corporations. Common types of activity by Russian cyber criminals include a wide variety of criminal activity, such as personal data theft, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, financial fraud, money laundering, and ransomware use. Hacktivism conducted by Russian actors is typically politically motivated; Russian organizations, the government, and local media outlets are often targeted by both foreign and domestic hacktivists in response to perceived physical or political aggression by the Russian Government. Russian laws and policies, including extradition laws and domestic monitoring, may have an impact on how foreign organizations operate within Russia. Restrictions on extradition of Russian citizens from the country significantly limit cooperation for investigations into cyber incidents and have led to conflict between Russian and U.S. authorities. Additionally, Russian internet monitoring and censorship are more significant than in many Western nations. ",['No ttp provided'],APT29

" iSIGHT Partners believes cyber crime to be the most prevalent threat to the healthcare sector. Data stored by healthcare entities that could be monetized or otherwise exploited for financial gain is the primary target for such actors, although the compromise of health-related websites for various purposes and the use of ransomware against healthcare entities is also common. Healthcare-related entities also pose an attractive target for cyber espionage actors seeking sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property or other information that could be used for strategic awareness or market exploitation. Hacktivists do not often target the healthcare sector, although healthcare-related entities have been attacked as parts of broader campaigns targeting particular governments or countries. We have also observed some campaigns launched against health organizations due to specific grievances. Researchers have demonstrated methods by which embedded medical devices, such as infusion pumps, can be compromised. In addition, potential threats to certain industrial control systems (ICS), including electrical grids, could impact the hospitals and health facilities that they service. In the U.S. the protection of health data is covered under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) with some state laws adding further requirements.

"[' Overview Figure 1: Brazil threat intensity ratings (for an explanation of the ThreatScape Enterprise Threat Intensity Ratings, see 16-00002550 , Feb. 29, 2016) We believe Brazil is a major hub of cyber crime and hacktivist activity, primarily conducted by Brazilian actors against domestic entities; the country remains more a target for cyber espionage than a source. In the last year, Brazil\'s political and economic situation has created an environment of turbulence that is likely to increase malicious cyber activity. In 2015, the country fell into the deepest recession the country had experienced since the 1930s, with a GDP loss of 3.8 percent and inflation that caused the Brazilian real to lose 35 percent of its previous value. Brazil\'s economic prospects have been likewise bleak in 2016; in March, its central bank announced that it had revised its predictions for the economy, anticipating it to shrink 3.5 percent for the year. In the political arena, Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff was impeached and suspended from her post in May 2016 for alleged poor administration and manipulation of government fiscal accounts, with a trial pending. Many of the officials and lawmakers prosecuting her, including, for example, Lower House Speaker Eduardo Cunha, who led the impeachment drive against Rousseff, are also under investigation for various corruption-related charges, and Rousseff has called the efforts to oust her a political coup. Two significant pieces of legislation related to Internet security, the Marco Civil da Internet and Carolina Dieckmann Computer Crimes Law, have been passed in recent years, establishing the rights of Brazilian Internet users and defining several online activities as crimes, including unauthorized access of electronic devices, disruption of electronic devices and Internet utilities and credit card counterfeiting. However, significant gaps in the laws remain, and many legal analysts view the penalties imposed by Brazilian cyber crime laws as too lenient to deter criminals.

Besides strategic and diplomatic interests, economic issues are a key driver of cyber espionage activity directed against Brazilian entities; the country\'s natural resources, particularly iron ore, are highly prized by major manufacturing nations including China, and the discovery of major offshore oil reserves has also attracted the interest of actors with a focus on energy. For example, in 2014, the China-nexus Social Network Team (aka APT15) targeted Brazilian energy/environmental sector organizations , including stateâ\x80\x90owned oil company Petrobras and Brazil\'s Institute of Environment and Renewable Resources (IBAMA), that were party to a consortium with two Chinese firms to explore Brazil\'s oil fields. Additionally, Brazil was a target of global operations conducted by Russia-nexus groups Turla Team and Koala Team , as well as China-nexus 338 Team and Codoso Team (aka APT19). Documents leaked by Edward Snowden published in September 2013 also reportedly revealed that the US compromised both the communications of Brazil\'s President Dilma Rousseff and the networks of Petrobras. While visibility into Brazil\'s cyber espionage efforts is limited, open sources provide some details on Brazil\'s cyber defense capabilities. In June 2012, the military launched a Cyberdefense Center (CDCiber), which is reportedly composed of about 100 personnel located in Brasilia and tasked with coordinating the cyber security efforts of the armed forces. The Brazilian Department of Information and Communications Security has also partnered with the University of Brasilia to serve as a cyber intelligence clearinghouse since at least 2011. Additionally, Brazil has used the perception of being victimized by cyber espionage, particularly from the US, to situate itself as a leader in the region for Internet governance issues; for example, the country has taken a leading role in organizing the NETmundial Initiative , with meetings held in Brazil in 2014 and 2015. Projects to build fiber optic cables connecting Brazil directly to Europe and other countries without routing through the US are also underway. Cyber Crime We assess that Brazil will continue to be a major hub for cyber crime activity, and that Brazilian cyber criminals primarily target domestic entities and individuals. The country frequently places in ""Top Five"" lists of various global cyber crime rankings, and multiple open sources claim that cyber crime activity in the country has increased within the past few years. Cyber criminals in Brazil tend to use popular social media sites and fairly accessible public forums and applications to communicate and publicly advertise their products, due in part to the lack of deterrence from strong law enforcement efforts. Brazil is particularly known for banking malware, and the largest banks in the country are routinely targeted by cyber crime actors. Brazilian cyber criminals develop their own custom malware and use existing malware to compromise targets. While many Brazilian banks use various forms of multi-factor authentication, Brazilian cyber criminals are constantly developing methods for defeating them. In May 2015, for example, we reported on a phishing kit that successfully bypassed one-time password (OTP) and SMS protection systems in an attack targeting Ita International Bank in Brazil. Since many authentication methods rely on mobile devices, we anticipate that Brazilian threat actors will become increasingly interested in exploiting these devices, especially as mobile payment methods become more popular in Brazil. In August 2015, we observed an ongoing discussion between underground actors about the use of Near Field Communication (NFC) mobile apps to facilitate fraudulent operations in Brazil , illustrating their interest in exploiting this type of technology. Additionally, the popular online Brazilian payment system ""boletos,"" which generates ""tickets"" with which users can pay companies and other individuals, is also a popular target. Brazil is also subject to various other cyber crime campaigns, and these have occasionally impacted foreign entities as well. Phishing is a well-known problem in Brazil, and Brazilian cyber crime actors are also notable for using social media platforms to buy and sell illicit goods and services. We have observed a global increase in the use of ransomware in the past year, and Brazil has also seen its own share of such campaigns; in June 2015, we reported that the LeChiffre ransomware , which is likely operated by Brazilian actors, had been infecting Brazilian victims since at least January 2015. Additionally, while cyber crime actors in Brazil primarily target domestic enterprises, foreign entities have been impacted as well. For example, in October 2014, cyber security researcher Brian Krebs reported on ""replay attacks"" conducted against several US banks that were alleged to have originated from Brazil. Hacktivism Brazil-based hacktivist activity is primarily directed against domestic targets; antipathy toward the Brazilian Government, particularly in reaction to ongoing political scandals and the economic crisis, has been and will likely continue to be a key motivator in such attacks. Anti-establishment sentiment has also made corporations attractive targets. Although many Brazilian hacktivists claim affiliation with the worldwide Anonymous movement, they are largely attracted to its iconography and general antiâ\x80\x90establishment message and show little interest in international causes. As with cyber crime actors, Brazilian hacktivists face comparatively low risk of law enforcement efforts combatting their activity, and are thus less concerned with hiding their true identities. Recent political and economic crises have triggered widespread protests surrounding a number of different issues, and we have observed Brazilian hacktivists supporting physical protests with associated cyber threat activity. High-profile events have also been a magnet for Brazilian hacktivists; the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, for example, will likely be a key target for hacktivists voicing opposition to the expenses and alleged corruption surrounding the event, and Olympics-related campaigns have already begun. In February 2016, actors participating in the #OpOlympicHacking campaign targeted multiple Brazilian Government and corporate websites with data leak and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Similarly, the 2014 World Cup in Brazil provoked multiple low-impact attacks, with actors regularly targeting poorly protected domains related to highâ\x80\x90profile entities including Brazilian government and corporate organizations. Additionally, Brazilian entities are targets of regional and global hacktivist campaigns, and Brazilian hacktivists have also collaborated with other Latin American hacktivist groups such as Anonymous Peru . We expect Anonymous Peru, Anonymous Venezuela and other groups in the region to coordinate with Brazilian actors on some campaigns; for example, we anticipate that these groups may join Brazilian hacktivists in conducting hacktivist activity against the Brazilian Government or corporate sponsors of the 2016 Olympics. The linguistic gap between Brazil\'s Portuguese and the Spanish spoken by the rest of Latin and South America, however, will very likely make coordination between such groups more challenging to undertake and maintain. Additionally, Spanish-speaking groups have thus far not shown significant interest in the #OpOlympicHacking campaign, demonstrating the campaign\'s insular nature.

" Potential new U.S. sanctions targeting the Russian economy raise the risk of cyber operations targeting the reputation and operations of Western firms, especially in the mining, metals, railways, and shipping sectors. We are particularly concerned about the threat to railways, which Russia has increasingly targeted in Ukraine and against which it is encouraging unique research, probably to build a disruptive capability. These operations could punish the West by undermining its ability to prevent technology transfer, reduce the competitiveness of Western competitors to Russian firms, and even cause physical and economic damage to critical infrastructure in Western countries. While the proposed bill contains provisions to lighten sanctions on Russia if it demonstrates progress in fulfilling Minsk agreements or reducing its cyber operations, these are unlikely to happen soon.

"[' ACTION DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE MITIGATION Using Public Networks Malicious actors can sit on the same network and monitor unencrypted information coming to and from a computer. Sometimes they can set up on their own network and disguise it as a legitimate one to collect even more information. The Fallout Team , a cyber espionage team with a South Korea-nexus, has compromised business travelers through malicious spoofed software updates delivered via hotel Wi-Fi networks. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your Internet traffic from your computer to the end destination. Do not click to update software when on a shared public network. Using a Guessable Password If hackers knew your computer username and password and if the firewall allowed for remote log ins, they could remotely access your computer. During the Qatar National Bank (QNB) breach in April 2016, attackers likely obtained legitimate credentials from a SQL injection attack and used them to access the FileShare System. Use strong passwords. Change passwords often and as soon as possible after a breach. Use a different password for each online account. Use two-factor authentication. Inserting a Disk or USB Hackers can easily modify read-write disks and USB drives to infect computers with malware and spread malware from computer to computer. Read-only CDs or DVDs also can have malware, but are a lower threat. In October 2016, actor qpalzm01 advertised the Blackmail Bitcoin Ransomware 2016 , highlighting a distribution tactic involving USB drives which could allow for more targeted ransomware attacks. Avoid inserting disks or USBs of unknown origin or ones that could have been used in less secure computers. If files need transferred from such devices, transfer them to a stand-alone system first with no sensitive data to scan for viruses. Charging a Phone on a Computer Malicious actors can infect a phone through apps or downloads, for example, and then can infect a computer once the phone is plugged into it, since charging a phone on a computer essentially turns the phone into a USB. The Hamweq.A worm spread via removable USB drives and used smartphones as a carrier when connected to a Windows PC. Charge a phone in a portable USB charger or an outlet, or via a USB condom that blocks data transfer to and from the phone. ACTION DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE MITIGATION Running Outdated Software Hackers use various tools to scan for outdated or unpatched software, like operating systems, browsers, or plug-ins. Companies often stop updating software at all after a certain point, so known vulnerabilities would remain. Microsoft announced in January 2017 that it will discontinue security updates to Windows 7 in January 2020 unless customers pay for customized support. Make sure your software is still supported, and preferably the newest version. Update software automatically. Visiting a Webpage Hackers can conduct a drive-by download by submitting malicious advertisements even to popular, legitimate websites. These ads automatically redirect visitors to a malicious, sometimes invisible, website that identifies and exploits any Internet browser vulnerabilities the visitor might have without visitors even needing to click on the ad. In late 2015, the Forbes website unknowingly had malicious ads that infected some visitors computers. Koala Team , which focuses on energy, academia, and pharmaceutical sectors, uses waterhole attacks against targets, where it infects a website targeted employees would probably visit. Have updated anti-virus protection. Browse the Internet in an account without administrator privileges or use a virtual machine. Change your browser preferences to block ads and scripts. Do not consent when a website wants you to install plugins or extensions. Downloading Software Online Malicious actors can bundle software, music, or movies online with malware. The Qtipr.com browser hijacker , which constantly displays popup ads, can unknowingly be installed when users download free videos, files, and software from questionable websites. Download only at reputable sites. Be suspicious of free downloads. Have up-to-date anti-virus software. ACTION DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE MITIGATION Clicking on a Link Malicious actors can direct hyperlinks to a website that automatically launches malware or that is designed to capture log-in credentials, even if the link looks like it goes to a legitimate website. Malicious actors can also link to a picture that launches malware once the picture loads. As of November 2016, FireEye detected unidentified threat actors sending emails with shortened bit.ly links that redirected targets to websites with malicious .RAR archives that would download the WHITEWALK backdoor on victims computers. Do not click on links or load unexpected photos from emails. Make sure your email provider does not allow scripts to run in emails. Type in or search for the home page address of popular websites instead. Opening an Email Attachment Hackers can disguise malicious executable files as pictures, documents, pdfs, etc. so you cannot just rely on the file name to determine if a file is safe. Hackers can also spoof the from address, so the email may appear to come from a friend. In August 2016, APT29 sent out phishing emails with attachments to targets in organizations that worked closely with US and European governments. The two spoofed from addresses were real think tank employees. Check with the sender before opening attachments you do not expect. If you must open an unverified attachment, do so on a fully backed-up computer to minimize the repercussions in case it is malicious. ']",['No ttp provided'],Koala Team

" Cyber espionage is a significant threat to public and private organizations in Israel, including government, defense, academia, aerospace, and infrastructure providers. Threat vectors include spear phishing and watering holes, and most of the observed activity originates from Iran- or China-based actors. While Iran seeks political and military intelligence, China seeks information on regional politics and security and defense technologies for military modernization, as well as intellectual property to benefit domestic industry. Other actors include Middle Eastern groups seeking information on regional security and the Israel-Gaza conflict, and Russia conducting global reconnaissance. Financially motivated cyber crime is a threat affecting industries including finance, energy, and media through threat vectors including credential theft, laundering, ransomware, insider threats, and ATM exploitation. Hacktivist activity targeting Israel is common , primarily by foreign actors opposing Israeli policies and rhetoric on political, religious, and human rights grounds. Actors include ISIS affiliates, Palestinians, Iranians, Pakistanis, Lebanese, and Bangladeshis. Targets include government, defense, nuclear energy, and academia, though anti-Israel hacktivists often consider all websites on Israeli web servers or involving the Jewish diaspora as legitimate targets. Israel enforces relatively lenient data protection regulations. Israel permits cross-border data transfer, does not require data breach notification to victims or authorities, and does not enforce minimum data security standards for database controllers. Israel will continue to make progress aligning its export controls with global implementations of the 2013 Wassenaar Agreement on Intrusion and Surveillance Items, which imposes international standards for subjecting cyber security tools to export controls to reduce the proliferation of dual-use technologies used by malicious actors . Prior to the agreement, Israel, though not a Wassenaar signatory, had committed to fully importing Wassenaar's language into national export controls, resulting in Israel being automatically bound by the ambiguous text of the 2013 agreement. However, in mid-2016, Israel announced plans to liberalize its export controls through measures including a presumption of approval for exporters and periodic review of international Wassenaar implementation to synchronize national controls with global practices.

" Cyber espionage is a threat that targets public and private organizations in the Belgian Government, military, energy, healthcare, and telecommunications sectors. Most activity has been from Russia seeking geopolitical, defense, and proprietary information and, to a lesser extent, from China conducting intellectual property theft and signals intelligence. Evidence suggests India targeted the government and military to expand a global campaign for geopolitical information, and Western operations for global signals intelligence may have targeted telecommunications. Cyber crime is frequent in Belgium , generally in the form of credential theft, business email compromise, and extortion-motivated data leaks and commonly targets financial and insurance institutions. Hacktivist activity in Belgium is very common , caused mostly by domestic actors and targeting government, defense, finance, media, and transportation. Belgium imposes extensive privacy regulations on corporations for processing personally identifiable information (PII).

" Cyber espionage is a threat that targets public and private organizations in Poland. Targets include government, defense, energy, and research institutions. Russia has conducted most observed activity, likely to gather intelligence on government, defense, diplomatic affairs, and for intellectual property. Cyber crime is common in Poland , with activity including compromise of bank accounts, payment cards, business email, automatic teller machines (ATMs), credential theft, and ransomware. Hacktivist activity targets Polish industries including government, finance, defense, law enforcement, and telecommunications. Threat vectors include distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and data leaks. Much observed activity is from Russian state-sponsored hacktivist personas targeting Poland for its perceived antagonism toward Russia's national interests, including support for the Ukrainian Government, criticism of confident and expansive Russian foreign policy, and positioning troops along its eastern border in light of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Russian information operations may implicate Poland . Russia perceives the former Soviet bloc nation as an opponent, partially owing to historic enmity, favorable Polish-Ukrainian relations, and Poland's instrumentality in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), an organization that Moscow labels a threat to Russia's interests. We believe that in addition to conducting espionage against Poland with an actor sanctioned for information operations, Moscow employed a Ukrainian-nationalist persona to target Polish defense and government and used a Polish persona to target the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Recent legislation gives the Polish Government broad surveillance and internet control authority. Recently adopted antiterrorism and surveillance bills permit the government, which has previously subscribed to third-party surveillance company ""Hacking Team,"" to collect internet and telecommunications data of citizens without court approval.

 YARA rules can be used to hunt for operational technology (OT) malware targeting production environments. Mandiant Threat Intelligence suggests a series of hunting recommendations based on observations from previously observed OT malware. Defenders can create YARA rules to identify files that contain capabilities to interact with OT assets by searching for different OT-related toolmarks and strings. We recommend that asset owners become familiar with these recommendations and use them to review collection sources for their OT networks and assets. ,"['Malware Propagation and Deployment', 'Network Reconnaissance', 'Malware Research and Development']",Koala Team

" The technologies used to operate industrial production at the plant floor level are vital for a business to exist. Organizations may spend more than 10 percent of their budgets on security without protecting what matters the most. Regardless of increasing awareness about threats to operational technologies (OT), board members, executives, and security officers are still often unaware that the technology operating the economic engine of their enterprise invites undetected subversion. In 2016, Mandiant Threat Intelligence published a report examining six technological weaknesses adversaries can use to undermine a plant's operations. Now, in 2020, we release an update illustrating that while strides are being made to improve cyber security on the plant floor, the concerns still exist. Based on the results of Mandiant's industrial control systems (ICS) security health assessments (ICS Healthchecks), red teaming engagements, and research, we illustrate these weaknesses and provide examples we have observed.

" Cyber espionage campaigns targeting the Netherlands pose a moderate threat due to the Netherlands' geopolitical position and status as a technically advanced nation. Cyber espionage is likely aimed at gaining intelligence regarding geopolitical and economic issues as well as intellectual property. The cyber crime threat posed to the Netherlands is moderate, commensurate with that of a wealthy country having the highest penetration of household broadband connections in the world. Dutch servers are especially attractive to cyber criminals as a jumping off point for activity against other countries because the Netherlands is an international internet hub with many internet providers available to switch between. Hacktivism activity generally poses a comparatively low threat to entities in the Netherlands, and hacktivist activity emanating from the country is similarly low. High-profile political events involving the Netherlands may spark cyber influence activity. As the 2017 Dutch elections approach, we are already seeing some activity similar to recent activity in the U.S. where the Russian Government conducted influence operations in support of strategic political objectives. The Dutch populace will probably be exposed to any well-organized cyber propaganda campaigns in the Netherlands as the government rarely interferes with media and social media penetration in the Netherlands, which is among the highest in Western Europe. Since January 2016, Dutch companies are legally required to report data leaks and hacks that could affect others. The Netherlands is home to The Hague Security Delta (HSD), the largest security cluster in Europe, in which the public and private sectors collaborate on issues such as creating a testbed to improve critical infrastructure cyber security. Another key piece of cyber legislation, a new law called Act Cybercrime III , was proposed to the Dutch Parliament in December that, if passed, would allow law enforcement to covertly find and exploit vulnerabilities in software that cyber criminals use.

"[' ACTION DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE MITIGATION Using Public Networks Malicious actors can sit on the same network and monitor unencrypted information coming to and from a computer. Sometimes they can set up on their own network and disguise it as a legitimate one to collect even more information. The Fallout Team , a cyber espionage team with a South Korea-nexus, has compromised business travelers through malicious spoofed software updates delivered via hotel Wi-Fi networks. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your Internet traffic from your computer to the end destination. Do not click to update software when on a shared public network. Using a Guessable Password If hackers knew your computer username and password and if the firewall allowed for remote log ins, they could remotely access your computer. During the Qatar National Bank (QNB) breach in April 2016, attackers likely obtained legitimate credentials from a SQL injection attack and used them to access the FileShare System. Use strong passwords. Change passwords often and as soon as possible after a breach. Use a different password for each online account. Use two-factor authentication. Inserting a Disk or USB Hackers can easily modify read-write disks and USB drives to infect computers with malware and spread malware from computer to computer. Read-only CDs or DVDs also can have malware, but are a lower threat. In October 2016, actor qpalzm01 advertised the Blackmail Bitcoin Ransomware 2016 , highlighting a distribution tactic involving USB drives which could allow for more targeted ransomware attacks. Avoid inserting disks or USBs of unknown origin or ones that could have been used in less secure computers. If files need transferred from such devices, transfer them to a stand-alone system first with no sensitive data to scan for viruses. Charging a Phone on a Computer Malicious actors can infect a phone through apps or downloads, for example, and then can infect a computer once the phone is plugged into it, since charging a phone on a computer essentially turns the phone into a USB. The Hamweq.A worm spread via removable USB drives and used smartphones as a carrier when connected to a Windows PC. Charge a phone in a portable USB charger or an outlet, or via a USB condom that blocks data transfer to and from the phone. ACTION DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE MITIGATION Running Outdated Software Hackers use various tools to scan for outdated or unpatched software, like operating systems, browsers, or plug-ins. Companies often stop updating software at all after a certain point, so known vulnerabilities would remain. Microsoft announced in January 2017 that it will discontinue security updates to Windows 7 in January 2020 unless customers pay for customized support. Make sure your software is still supported, and preferably the newest version. Update software automatically. Visiting a Webpage Hackers can conduct a drive-by download by submitting malicious advertisements even to popular, legitimate websites. These ads automatically redirect visitors to a malicious, sometimes invisible, website that identifies and exploits any Internet browser vulnerabilities the visitor might have without visitors even needing to click on the ad. In late 2015, the Forbes website unknowingly had malicious ads that infected some visitors computers. Koala Team , which focuses on energy, academia, and pharmaceutical sectors, uses waterhole attacks against targets, where it infects a website targeted employees would probably visit. Have updated anti-virus protection. Browse the Internet in an account without administrator privileges or use a virtual machine. Change your browser preferences to block ads and scripts. Do not consent when a website wants you to install plugins or extensions. Downloading Software Online Malicious actors can bundle software, music, or movies online with malware. The Qtipr.com browser hijacker , which constantly displays popup ads, can unknowingly be installed when users download free videos, files, and software from questionable websites. Download only at reputable sites. Be suspicious of free downloads. Have up-to-date anti-virus software. ACTION DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE MITIGATION Clicking on a Link Malicious actors can direct hyperlinks to a website that automatically launches malware or that is designed to capture log-in credentials, even if the link looks like it goes to a legitimate website. Malicious actors can also link to a picture that launches malware once the picture loads. As of November 2016, FireEye detected unidentified threat actors sending emails with shortened bit.ly links that redirected targets to websites with malicious .RAR archives that would download the WHITEWALK backdoor on victims computers. Do not click on links or load unexpected photos from emails. Make sure your email provider does not allow scripts to run in emails. Type in or search for the home page address of popular websites instead. Opening an Email Attachment Hackers can disguise malicious executable files as pictures, documents, pdfs, etc. so you cannot just rely on the file name to determine if a file is safe. Hackers can also spoof the from address, so the email may appear to come from a friend. In August 2016, APT29 sent out phishing emails with attachments to targets in organizations that worked closely with US and European governments. The two spoofed from addresses were real think tank employees. Check with the sender before opening attachments you do not expect. If you must open an unverified attachment, do so on a fully backed-up computer to minimize the repercussions in case it is malicious.

" On June 27, 2017, many organizations reported significant disruptions attributed to a variant of the Petya ransomware. This report evaluates potential explanations of the actors and intent behind this event. The most plausible explanation for this event is that politically motivated, likely anti-Ukrainian actors are responsible. Different observations highlight two possible variations of the scenario: Russian state-linked perpetrators or non-state, anti-Ukraine perpetrators. A somewhat less viable scenario is that financially motivated actors intended the event to be a diversion. The scenario that financially motivated actors perpetrated the event primarily to collect ransom payments is the least viable of the scenarios considered. ",['No ttp provided'],Sandworm Team
" FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence surmises that several of the most significant observed cyber incidents in 2016 and 2017 were potentially triggered by nation-state policy decisions. These incidents include disruptive and destructive incidents linked to North Korean, Russian, and Iranian actors, as well as information operations linked to Russia and Middle Eastern disputes. We suggest that it is important for both public and private sector organizations to remain vigilant to potential cyber threat reprisals to conventional nation-state actions, as cyber responses to policy decisions frequently target private sector entities in adversary nations. We anticipate that in 2018, nation-states will continue to use cyber means alongside other international relations tools to support strategic goals and respond to perceived threats. Russia-, Iran-, China-, and North Korea-nexus actors have all demonstrated willingness to direct cyber threat activity against private sector targets in adversary nations particularly in the energy, critical infrastructure, financial, and media sectors.

" In the first four months of 2022, Mandiant identified more Russian-sponsored disruptive cyberattacks against Ukraine than it has during the past eight years. Several of these cyberattacks were coupled with concurrent information operations, including manipulation of a TV broadcast and dissemination of a deepfake video impersonating the Ukrainian president falsely announcing Ukraine's surrender. Mandiant suggests that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused some temporary disruption to the Russian-speaking cyber crime ecosystem, such as causing ideological divisions within threat groups and inspiring actors to use cyber capabilities in support of Russia or Ukraine. Mandiant observed numerous hacktivists claim to conduct threat activity in support of Russia or Ukraine. We suggest the conflict brought about a significant resurgence in global hacktivism and/or the use of hacktivist tactics , which had declined in the latter half of the last decade.

" Mandiant has observed several significant disruptive and destructive attacks related to the 2022 Ukraine conflict to date. We expect to see additional disruptive and destructive attacks against Ukrainian targets, particularly in the government, financial, energy and utilities, and media and entertainment sectors, and potentially international organizations as well. There is significant precedent for Russian use of disruptive and destructive cyber attacks, particularly to support political and military objectives in Ukraine, including sabotage, compellence, punishment, and undermining public confidence in the Ukrainian government and institutions. ",['Malware Propagation and Deployment'],Sandworm Team
" Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that Russia will conduct additional destructive or disruptive cyber attacks connected to the crisis in Ukraine. Russian cyber attacks almost certainly will focus first on Ukraine, with Western/NATO allies also being possible targets. NATO and Western sanctions and responses likely will heavily influence Russia's perception of high-priority targets for retaliation, and Russian action may be focused against the financial industry, oil and gas sector, and media and entertainment. Organizations making statements condemning Russian aggression and/or supporting Ukraine and organizations taking actions to restrict Russian participation in international commerce, competitions, and events face elevated risk of future reprisal. We assess that Sandworm and UNC2589 are two of the most likely actors to conduct cyber attacks in retaliation, although we judge that all high-profile Russian threat actors will continue or increase cyber espionage to enhance decision advantage against Ukrainian and NATO government targets.

" Cyber espionage and disruptive/destructive attacks continue to pose the greatest threats to the petroleum industry. Iran, Russia, China, and Vietnam have demonstrated the capability and willingness to conduct extensive reconnaissance activities necessary to carry out espionage campaigns, while Russia and Iran have carried out destructive and disruptive attacks on critical infrastructure and key resources associated with the industry. Cyber criminals routinely compromise the petroleum industry and present a moderate threat . We have recently observed distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, ransomware, system compromise, and insider threats affecting the industry. Hacktivist groups present an ongoing and moderate threat to the petroleum industry. Hacktivist groups targeting the industry are motivated by a variety of ideological and political rationales. Companies in this vertical are likely targets of hacktivists due to the significant publicity associated with these attacks. We expect various nation-state actors to maintain and expand their capacity to launch disruptive and destructive attacks, and targeting of petroleum firms will continue to grow as more countries develop cyber espionage, disruptive, and destructive capabilities.

" This report will be released publicly on Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2016, at 8 am EST In the past several years, a flood of vulnerabilities has hit industrial control systems (ICS) the technological backbone of electric grids, water supplies, and production lines. These vulnerabilities affect the reliable operation of sensors, programmable controllers, software, and networking equipment used to automate and monitor the physical processes that keep our modern world running. Since 2000, FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has identified nearly 1,600 publicly disclosed ICS vulnerabilities. Many of these are unpatched and some are simply unpatchable due to outdated technology providing open paths for adversarial exploitation. Nation-state cyber threat actors have exploited five of these vulnerabilities in attacks since 2009. Unfortunately, security personnel from manufacturing, energy, water, and other industries are frequently unaware of their own control system assets, let alone the vulnerabilities that affect them. Organizations operating these systems are missing the warnings and leaving their industrial environments exposed.

" Russia's ""Zapad"" 2017 military exercise will potentially be the largest war game since the fall of the Soviet Union. Russia has previously used war games to train troops and test tactics, but also to convey power and launch invasions. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has high confidence that Russia is integrating cyber capabilities into its military strategy. Russia-nexus threat actors have used cyber attacks in addition to cyber espionage and other forms of information warfare to punish and undermine Ukraine. Russia may conduct actual intrusions before as well as during the war game, believing it can test capabilities and cause minor effects without risking escalation or public attribution. Potential targets for Russian cyber operations during Zapad include military command and control (C C) systems, ballistic missile defense systems, and energy sector companies in countries to Russia's west. Zapad 2017 may provide new insight into how Russia uses deniable operations during military exercises, and better prepare Russia's targets for how it might incorporate cyber capabilities during a real crisis or conflict.

" In 2019, state-sponsored threat actors continued to leverage destructive attacks to achieve strategic and tactical objectives in response to geopolitical factors that will likely continue to motivate the deployment of destructive malware, wipers, ransomware, and similar offensive activity in 2020 and beyond. FireEye Intelligence identified new instances of destructive malware operations against energy, financial, media, and hospitality entities in 2019. Iran's use of POWERTON and RULER malware in 2019 bears monitoring given links between these malware families and previous destructive SHAMOON incidents, especially considering heightened tensions between Iran and the U.S./U.S. allies. Two additional new wiper malware families linked to Iran-sponsored actors have also been detected, although as of February 2020, these have not been observed being deployed. While FireEye Intelligence did not observe Russian or North Korean activity leveraging destructive malware in 2019, it should be noted that both countries have previously demonstrated a willingness to undertake disruptive or destructive attacks in selective situations (e.g., triggered by geopolitical events). These state-sponsored actors could choose to deploy these capabilities again (e.g., during high-profile events such as the upcoming 2020 Olympics in Tokyo).

" The following report is based on a response to a query submitted by a customer via our Analyst Access service. FireEye Threat Intelligence assesses with low confidence that state-on-state compromise is uncommon and is discussed publicly with even less frequency. We believe that a successful compromise of adversary-controlled assets could provide valuable insight into an adversary's behavior and tools, which might facilitate future offensive and defensive efforts. It is possible that evolving cyber norms , including policy changes, leaks exposing nation-state operations, and the influence of private cyber security and malware vendors, will increase the frequency of state-on-state compromise attempts and the frequency with which this type of operation becomes public knowledge. FireEye Threat Intelligence surmises that the primary way in which state-on-state compromise might impact most network defenders would be in impeding attribution with false flag operations or other denial and deception tactics. Acknowledging the possibility that attackers may have used deceptive tactics, precision, and attention to detail in investigations are important first steps in identifying the deliberate use of misleading indicators.

" Mandiant Threat Intelligence is monitoring the escalating tension between Ukraine and Russia and looking for reflections of increased cyber threat activity from Russian state-sponsored actors as a result. Sandworm probably poses the greatest and most likely threat to Ukraine, based on its historical cyber attacks on Ukraine and its apparent mandate for disruptive and destructive operations. Sandworm is sponsored by Russian military intelligence and would almost certainly support Russian military operations in Ukraine in some capacity. We may also see an uptick in cyber espionage operations from APT28, also sponsored by Russian military intelligence, or TEMP.Armageddon and TEMP.Vermin actors whose previous targeting since inception is near exclusively against Ukrainian government targets.

U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military units should remain alert for the potential intensification of information operations during Zapad and other military exercises. Anti-NATO and anti-U.S. military narratives are common themes for several information operations campaigns we track, which target the Baltic states, Poland, and Ukraine.

" The exploitation of zero-days has already matched the last peak in zero-day exploitation, which occurred in 2016. We surmise (based on this rate of exploitation and discovery) that this total may surpass the total for 2016 by the end of 2019. We assess with moderate confidence that zero-days are increasingly being used in targeted campaigns. As a result, the breadth of targeting, and thus the number of victims affected, has likely decreased. We noted a significant increase in the number of zero-days leveraged by groups that are suspected to be customers of private companies that supply offensive cyber capabilities. Additionally, we observed an increase in zero-days leveraged against targets in the Middle East, and/or by groups with suspected ties to this region. We have observed a remarkable decrease in exploitation of zero-days by Russia and China since 2017. This is a remarkable change, since groups attributed to these countries leveraged the highest number of zero-days in earlier years, especially during the period 2012 2015. We observed a significant decline in zero-days incorporated into exploit kits and used by financially motivated groups. Since the end of 2017, we have not observed any exploit kits that incorporated any vulnerabilities before a patch was issued. However, we have observed financially motivated actors use recently patched vulnerabilities in exploit kits and other tools, such as malicious document builders. While access to zero-days has long been a potential factor for measuring threat actor sophistication, FireEye Threat Intelligence suggests that the rise of private security firms and bug bounty programs may have complicated the reliability of this metric by increasingly commodifying zero-days as a resource.

" iSIGHT Partners believes cyber crime to be the most prevalent threat to the healthcare sector. Data stored by healthcare entities that could be monetized or otherwise exploited for financial gain is the primary target for such actors, although the compromise of health-related websites for various purposes and the use of ransomware against healthcare entities is also common. Healthcare-related entities also pose an attractive target for cyber espionage actors seeking sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property or other information that could be used for strategic awareness or market exploitation. Hacktivists do not often target the healthcare sector, although healthcare-related entities have been attacked as parts of broader campaigns targeting particular governments or countries. We have also observed some campaigns launched against health organizations due to specific grievances. Researchers have demonstrated methods by which embedded medical devices, such as infusion pumps, can be compromised. In addition, potential threats to certain industrial control systems (ICS), including electrical grids, could impact the hospitals and health facilities that they service. In the U.S. the protection of health data is covered under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) with some state laws adding further requirements.

Past incidents include network-scanning activity, database compromise, spearphishing, and attempted disruptive/destructive attacks. Common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in pro-Russian information operations related to elections include amplification of organic and fabricated content using social media, hack and leak operations, and the use of false hacktivist personas as well as disruption and compromise of media channels. In addition to espionage that takes place in the lead-up to elections, ongoing espionage activity may attempt to support hack-and-leak operations in the future, collect compromised credentials for later operations, and provide data for traditional intelligence missions.

" Russian intelligence services likely have a close relationship with Russian cyber criminals, particularly those not engaged in activities targeting Russians. This relationship has been observed in the past in a variety of incidents involving cyber criminals apparently creating or customizing malware for use in Russia-nexus espionage operations. These cyber criminals operate with relatively low risk of arrest in Russia due to a combination of legal and practical restraints on police, including an inability to extradite criminals outside of Russia, limited cooperation with international law enforcement organizations, and limited resources for law enforcement leading to prioritizing of targeting actors whose activity directly affects Russians. While most of these limitations are practical, we speculate that Russian authorities also intentionally allow underground markets of actors targeting outside the country to flourish within Russia to have a pool of highly skilled actors and developers that authorities can requisition for use in potential espionage and cyber war operations. In addition to any dedicated work that these actors could perform for Russian cyber war efforts, it is likely that there are various ways that existing cyber crime malware, tools, and services in the underground could be used for disruptive, destructive, information warfare, and intelligence gathering operations.

We assess with high confidence opportunistic hacktivist actors present a high-frequency (but low-impact) threat to regional government systems and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We assess with moderate confidence that cyber espionage presents an ongoing, moderate-intensity threat to regional government networks, as these systems often contain potentially valuable information, such as insight into major industries and military units operating within their jurisdictions. Additionally, regional governments often oversee elections, making them extremely attractive targets for espionage actors seeking to disrupt or discredit the electoral process.

" Cyber crime is responsible for most attacks directed against hospitality companies. Cyber criminals use several methods to capitalize on a successful attack, theft of payment and sensitive data, and extortive attacks. The cyber espionage threat to the hospitality industry is dependent on the company's location and its political and social environment. Nation-state actors increasingly target the sector to collect information on hotel guests of interest, gather corporate information, and conduct destructive attacks. Hacktivism poses a minor threat to organizations in the hospitality industry. Targeting of entities in the hospitality sector primarily occurs opportunistically or as part of broader campaigns against multiple targets.

" Cyber espionage and government-sponsored disruptive attacks pose a moderate threat to Romania. Romanian Government, military, and private sector institutions have been targeted by Russian, Chinese, and South Korean espionage groups. We believe that increasing tension between Russia and the West could potentially lead to an escalation in Russian activity. Moreover, given the established diplomatic relationship between Romania and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, increased tensions between North Korea and the U.S. and its allies could lead to an uptick in cyber espionage activity originating from South Korea as well. Cyber criminals routinely compromise Romanian entities and present a moderate threat. We regularly observe multiple malware families targeting Romanian institutions, and have evidence the back-end system of a Romanian bank was compromised. Hacktivism remains a low threat to Romania. We continue to observe some hacktivist activity occasionally targeting Romanian entities, and we have observed a few Romanian individuals partaking in hacktivist incidents as well, including data leaks and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

" Mandiant assesses with high confidence that financially motivated cyber crime affecting Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) systems is relatively common. These systems are likely affected most often as part of opportunistic campaigns rather than actors specifically seeking VoIP access. While not a highly common threat at this time, Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that both video and audio deepfakes, including real-time capabilities that are able to run on consumer devices, will become increasingly effective and available in the mid to long term. This availability and efficacy will likely incentivize actors to adopt the technologies more often into social engineering schemes, including attacks related to business email compromise (BEC) campaigns. VoIP infrastructure should be considered an extension of the attack surface, requiring monitoring, maintenance, and auditing like any other element. As such, high-level mitigation considerations for VoIP threats primarily revolves around the inclusion of VoIP systems in standard IT security best practices, and the consideration of more custom controls where necessary.

" Mitigating the cyber risk by investing in prevention and response measures goes hand in hand with purchasing cyber insurance to minimize the amount of risk organizations simply accept. Cyber insurance covers much more than general liability insurance when it comes to costs stemming from a cyber incident, such as legal and investigative fees after a data breach, lost revenue from business interruption, and costs to third parties if their data were stolen, etc. Conducting a risk assessment before purchasing or renewing cyber insurance is helpful for customizing the policy. A risk assessment helps organizations determine what specific risks they want covered and what they can do to improve their security posture, which may result in increased insurance capacity and lower premiums. Many policies do not cover cyber incidents caused by a nation-state or terrorists, complicating the demand for accurate attribution. However, organizations that purposely avoid understanding why, how, and by whom their networks were penetrated open themselves up to similar cyber incidents in the future, potentially from the same actors.

" France has been repeatedly targeted by nation-state espionage groups, especially groups from China and Russia. Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that intellectual property theft is a significant driver of espionage activity and is likely to continue based on past targeting and the value of French intellectual property, especially in the transportation, aerospace, and defense sectors. Based on France's influential role in major global institutions such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union (EU), and the United Nations (UN), we assess with high confidence that information operations constitute a moderate threat to France and will continue. We assess with high confidence that France will likely remain a target of financially motivated cyber threat activity for the foreseeable future given the country's relatively high level of wealth and widespread use of technology. Targeted intrusions generally deliver the most damage per incident, but French institutions and individuals are most frequently threatened by common widely distributed malware for account takeover operations. While hacktivism in France generally takes the form of low-sophistication distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and website defacements, we assess with moderate confidence that major hacktivist movements based on persistent social issues, such as #GiletsJaunes , present a moderate threat to French institutions.

" North Korea would probably seek to use cyber operations not only to damage adversaries involved in an armed conflict, but to prevent other nations from providing support to their aggressors or to punish nations that do support United Nations Command efforts. North Korea could target civilians and the private sector in South Korea, the U.S., and elsewhere by employing ransomware, attempting to compromise human-machine interfaces (HMI) controlling critical infrastructure, or engage in hack-and-leak campaigns to undermine adversary morale. North Korea's cyber operations could be combined with electronic warfare to increase efficacy and deniability for civilian deaths, particularly those targeting aviation and other transportation industry targets. North Korea maintains the ability to interfere with the normal functioning of the financial system in South Korea and perhaps to cause at least limited disruption and reputation damage to the broader global financial system.

" Executive Summary Cyber espionage operations from Russia are highly active and are conducting aggressive campaigns against targets in line with Russian strategic and tactical interests. Russian information operations are actively used to influence foreign elections, political processes, and opinions regarding various issues ; observed examples of these campaigns include operations masquerading as pro-Islamic State hacktivist groups, anti-establishment hacktivist groups, news agencies, and political organizations. These campaigns were active in attempting to influence the global narrative around events such as the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and the 2016 Olympic Games. Cyber crime operations conducted by Russian actors remain a significant threat to many organizations, particularly in Western countries, and this activity has affected organizations ranging in size from small local financial organizations to large multinational corporations. Common types of activity by Russian cyber criminals include a wide variety of criminal activity, such as personal data theft, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, financial fraud, money laundering, and ransomware use. Hacktivism conducted by Russian actors is typically politically motivated; Russian organizations, the government, and local media outlets are often targeted by both foreign and domestic hacktivists in response to perceived physical or political aggression by the Russian Government. Russian laws and policies, including extradition laws and domestic monitoring, may have an impact on how foreign organizations operate within Russia. Restrictions on extradition of Russian citizens from the country significantly limit cooperation for investigations into cyber incidents and have led to conflict between Russian and U.S. authorities.

" Cyber espionage is a threat that targets public and private organizations in Poland. Targets include government, defense, energy, and research institutions. Russia has conducted most observed activity, likely to gather intelligence on government, defense, diplomatic affairs, and for intellectual property. Cyber crime is common in Poland , with activity including compromise of bank accounts, payment cards, business email, automatic teller machines (ATMs), credential theft, and ransomware. Hacktivist activity targets Polish industries including government, finance, defense, law enforcement, and telecommunications. Threat vectors include distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and data leaks. Much observed activity is from Russian state-sponsored hacktivist personas targeting Poland for its perceived antagonism toward Russia's national interests, including support for the Ukrainian Government, criticism of confident and expansive Russian foreign policy, and positioning troops along its eastern border in light of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Russian information operations may implicate Poland . Russia perceives the former Soviet bloc nation as an opponent, partially owing to historic enmity, favorable Polish-Ukrainian relations, and Poland's instrumentality in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), an organization that Moscow labels a threat to Russia's interests. We believe that in addition to conducting espionage against Poland with an actor sanctioned for information operations, Moscow employed a Ukrainian-nationalist persona to target Polish defense and government and used a Polish persona to target the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Recent legislation gives the Polish Government broad surveillance and internet control authority. Recently adopted antiterrorism and surveillance bills permit the government, which has previously subscribed to third-party surveillance company ""Hacking Team,"" to collect internet and telecommunications data of citizens without court approval.

" Cyber espionage is often misleadingly referred to as an ""advanced persistent threat,"" though cyber espionage actors are not always advanced or persistent. Rather than sophistication, cyber espionage is distinguished by motivation. Cyber espionage actors range from the amateurish to the incredibly sophisticated, but they all have a desire to obtain information that can be exploited to a competitive advantage. These actors are seeking intelligence on diplomacy or military affairs, dissidents or global economic conditions. Increasingly, they are also seeking intelligence on economic competitors. This intelligence is different from the commodity financial data that criminals seek and sell on the black market because it is not interchangeable. It has value to limited recipients, almost always nation-states, though proving their involvement is a difficult task. The same data might be targeted by hacktivists, but their inclination would be to expose it.

" Cyber espionage campaigns targeting the Netherlands pose a moderate threat due to the Netherlands' geopolitical position and status as a technically advanced nation. Cyber espionage is likely aimed at gaining intelligence regarding geopolitical and economic issues as well as intellectual property. The cyber crime threat posed to the Netherlands is moderate, commensurate with that of a wealthy country having the highest penetration of household broadband connections in the world. Dutch servers are especially attractive to cyber criminals as a jumping off point for activity against other countries because the Netherlands is an international internet hub with many internet providers available to switch between. Hacktivism activity generally poses a comparatively low threat to entities in the Netherlands, and hacktivist activity emanating from the country is similarly low. High-profile political events involving the Netherlands may spark cyber influence activity. As the 2017 Dutch elections approach, we are already seeing some activity similar to recent activity in the U.S. where the Russian Government conducted influence operations in support of strategic political objectives. The Dutch populace will probably be exposed to any well-organized cyber propaganda campaigns in the Netherlands as the government rarely interferes with media and social media penetration in the Netherlands, which is among the highest in Western Europe. Since January 2016, Dutch companies are legally required to report data leaks and hacks that could affect others.

" Russian cyber operations in the Middle East will likely continue to focus on espionage against regional government, military, energy, and science and technology targets. Russia may also combine its espionage activities with false-front hacktivism mainly targeting defense and media pursuant to Moscow's hybrid warfare strategy. Under this strategy, Moscow uses a blend of conventional arms, special operations forces, and cyber activities to achieve foreign policy goals while deliberately blurring the line between war and peacetime through aggressive operations that, individually, are not serious enough to provoke a full military response. Russia may seek information pertaining to regional armed conflicts, energy production, the political and military activities of the U.S. and its allies, defense-related science and technology, and protection of Russian assets. Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for these operations may include compromising undersea telecommunications cables, compromising air-gapped networks through USB malware or insider threat operations, using satellite-based command and control (C C), engaging in fourth-party intelligence collection, and conducting Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijacking. Moscow's information operations blur the line between espionage and hacktivism and are intended to influence targets' decision-making by controlling access to, and content of, news and other available information sources.

" The exploitation of zero-days has already matched the last peak in zero-day exploitation, which occurred in 2016. We surmise (based on this rate of exploitation and discovery) that this total may surpass the total for 2016 by the end of 2019. We assess with moderate confidence that zero-days are increasingly being used in targeted campaigns. As a result, the breadth of targeting, and thus the number of victims affected, has likely decreased. We noted a significant increase in the number of zero-days leveraged by groups that are suspected to be customers of private companies that supply offensive cyber capabilities. Additionally, we observed an increase in zero-days leveraged against targets in the Middle East, and/or by groups with suspected ties to this region. We have observed a remarkable decrease in exploitation of zero-days by Russia and China since 2017. This is a remarkable change, since groups attributed to these countries leveraged the highest number of zero-days in earlier years, especially during the period 2012 2015. We observed a significant decline in zero-days incorporated into exploit kits and used by financially motivated groups. Since the end of 2017, we have not observed any exploit kits that incorporated any vulnerabilities before a patch was issued. However, we have observed financially motivated actors use recently patched vulnerabilities in exploit kits and other tools, such as malicious document builders. While access to zero-days has long been a potential factor for measuring threat actor sophistication, FireEye Threat Intelligence suggests that the rise of private security firms and bug bounty programs may have complicated the reliability of this metric by increasingly commodifying zero-days as a resource.

Most activity targeting the DIB in the West is conducted by China-based actors seeking strategic and tactical information, including information to benefit China's military modernization and arms exports. China's activities also affect Japan, South Korea, Israel, India, Russia, and Taiwan. Russia-based actors conduct espionage for strategic and tactical intelligence, often in conjunction with regional conflicts such as the incursion into Ukraine and Syria, and have also targeted the U.S., North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) elements, and European defense expos. We observed Iran targeting the U.S. likely to improve domestic military capabilities, gain insights into the disposition of the U.S. military or the U.S. alliance with Israel, and to obtain information allowing for the destruction or degradation of information and operations. We suspect North Korea targets U.S. assets in South Korea and regional military elements for strategic information and to plan for destruction and degradation of U.S. and South Korean defense. India and Pakistan-based operations have targeted DIB organizations, including peripheral targets in the U.S. military. Hacktivism affects the DIB primarily through low-impact disruption or data disclosure attacks , often in regions including the U.S., Turkey, and Israel. Threat vectors include data leaks, intrusions, defacements, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Common motives include pro-Iran, pro-Assad, anti-Israel, or pro-Russia ideology. The pro-Russia group Cyber Berkut has claimed successful DDoS attacks and defacements against the U.S. DIB, and we suspect that Moscow uses this persona for information operations that combine hacktivism and espionage to manipulate public opinion and influence military and political decision making. Commoditized cyber crime, similar to that seen in other industries, affects the DIB . Companies operating in the DIB may face increased threat activity following ventures with Chinese or Russian firms. ",['No ttp provided'],Turla Team

Data stored by healthcare entities that could be monetized or otherwise exploited for financial gain is the primary target for such actors, although the compromise of health-related websites for various purposes and the use of ransomware against healthcare entities is also common. Healthcare-related entities also pose an attractive target for cyber espionage actors seeking sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual property or other information that could be used for strategic awareness or market exploitation. Hacktivists do not often target the healthcare sector, although healthcare-related entities have been attacked as parts of broader campaigns targeting particular governments or countries. We have also observed some campaigns launched against health organizations due to specific grievances. Researchers have demonstrated methods by which embedded medical devices, such as infusion pumps, can be compromised. In addition, potential threats to certain industrial control systems (ICS), including electrical grids, could impact the hospitals and health facilities that they service. In the U.S. the protection of health data is covered under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) with some state laws adding further requirements.

"[' Overview Figure 1: Brazil threat intensity ratings (for an explanation of the ThreatScape Enterprise Threat Intensity Ratings, see 16-00002550 , Feb. 29, 2016) We believe Brazil is a major hub of cyber crime and hacktivist activity, primarily conducted by Brazilian actors against domestic entities; the country remains more a target for cyber espionage than a source. In the last year, Brazil\'s political and economic situation has created an environment of turbulence that is likely to increase malicious cyber activity. In 2015, the country fell into the deepest recession the country had experienced since the 1930s, with a GDP loss of 3.8 percent and inflation that caused the Brazilian real to lose 35 percent of its previous value. Brazil\'s economic prospects have been likewise bleak in 2016; in March, its central bank announced that it had revised its predictions for the economy, anticipating it to shrink 3.5 percent for the year. In the political arena, Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff was impeached and suspended from her post in May 2016 for alleged poor administration and manipulation of government fiscal accounts, with a trial pending. Many of the officials and lawmakers prosecuting her, including, for example, Lower House Speaker Eduardo Cunha, who led the impeachment drive against Rousseff, are also under investigation for various corruption-related charges, and Rousseff has called the efforts to oust her a political coup. Two significant pieces of legislation related to Internet security, the Marco Civil da Internet and Carolina Dieckmann Computer Crimes Law, have been passed in recent years, establishing the rights of Brazilian Internet users and defining several online activities as crimes, including unauthorized access of electronic devices, disruption of electronic devices and Internet utilities and credit card counterfeiting. However, significant gaps in the laws remain, and many legal analysts view the penalties imposed by Brazilian cyber crime laws as too lenient to deter criminals. Cyber Espionage We continue to observe cyber espionage activity primarily directed against Brazil rather than conducted by it. Besides strategic and diplomatic interests, economic issues are a key driver of cyber espionage activity directed against Brazilian entities; the country\'s natural resources, particularly iron ore, are highly prized by major manufacturing nations including China, and the discovery of major offshore oil reserves has also attracted the interest of actors with a focus on energy. For example, in 2014, the China-nexus Social Network Team (aka APT15) targeted Brazilian energy/environmental sector organizations , including stateâ\x80\x90owned oil company Petrobras and Brazil\'s Institute of Environment and Renewable Resources (IBAMA), that were party to a consortium with two Chinese firms to explore Brazil\'s oil fields. Additionally, Brazil was a target of global operations conducted by Russia-nexus groups Turla Team and Koala Team , as well as China-nexus 338 Team and Codoso Team (aka APT19). Documents leaked by Edward Snowden published in September 2013 also reportedly revealed that the US compromised both the communications of Brazil\'s President Dilma Rousseff and the networks of Petrobras. While visibility into Brazil\'s cyber espionage efforts is limited, open sources provide some details on Brazil\'s cyber defense capabilities. In June 2012, the military launched a Cyberdefense Center (CDCiber), which is reportedly composed of about 100 personnel located in Brasilia and tasked with coordinating the cyber security efforts of the armed forces. The Brazilian Department of Information and Communications Security has also partnered with the University of Brasilia to serve as a cyber intelligence clearinghouse since at least 2011. Additionally, Brazil has used the perception of being victimized by cyber espionage, particularly from the US, to situate itself as a leader in the region for Internet governance issues; for example, the country has taken a leading role in organizing the NETmundial Initiative , with meetings held in Brazil in 2014 and 2015. Projects to build fiber optic cables connecting Brazil directly to Europe and other countries without routing through the US are also underway. Cyber Crime We assess that Brazil will continue to be a major hub for cyber crime activity, and that Brazilian cyber criminals primarily target domestic entities and individuals. The country frequently places in ""Top Five"" lists of various global cyber crime rankings, and multiple open sources claim that cyber crime activity in the country has increased within the past few years. Cyber criminals in Brazil tend to use popular social media sites and fairly accessible public forums and applications to communicate and publicly advertise their products, due in part to the lack of deterrence from strong law enforcement efforts. Brazil is particularly known for banking malware, and the largest banks in the country are routinely targeted by cyber crime actors. Brazilian cyber criminals develop their own custom malware and use existing malware to compromise targets. While many Brazilian banks use various forms of multi-factor authentication, Brazilian cyber criminals are constantly developing methods for defeating them. In May 2015, for example, we reported on a phishing kit that successfully bypassed one-time password (OTP) and SMS protection systems in an attack targeting Ita International Bank in Brazil. Since many authentication methods rely on mobile devices, we anticipate that Brazilian threat actors will become increasingly interested in exploiting these devices, especially as mobile payment methods become more popular in Brazil. In August 2015, we observed an ongoing discussion between underground actors about the use of Near Field Communication (NFC) mobile apps to facilitate fraudulent operations in Brazil , illustrating their interest in exploiting this type of technology. Additionally, the popular online Brazilian payment system ""boletos,"" which generates ""tickets"" with which users can pay companies and other individuals, is also a popular target. Brazil is also subject to various other cyber crime campaigns, and these have occasionally impacted foreign entities as well. Phishing is a well-known problem in Brazil, and Brazilian cyber crime actors are also notable for using social media platforms to buy and sell illicit goods and services. We have observed a global increase in the use of ransomware in the past year, and Brazil has also seen its own share of such campaigns; in June 2015, we reported that the LeChiffre ransomware , which is likely operated by Brazilian actors, had been infecting Brazilian victims since at least January 2015. Additionally, while cyber crime actors in Brazil primarily target domestic enterprises, foreign entities have been impacted as well. For example, in October 2014, cyber security researcher Brian Krebs reported on ""replay attacks"" conducted against several US banks that were alleged to have originated from Brazil. Hacktivism Brazil-based hacktivist activity is primarily directed against domestic targets; antipathy toward the Brazilian Government, particularly in reaction to ongoing political scandals and the economic crisis, has been and will likely continue to be a key motivator in such attacks. Anti-establishment sentiment has also made corporations attractive targets. Although many Brazilian hacktivists claim affiliation with the worldwide Anonymous movement, they are largely attracted to its iconography and general antiâ\x80\x90establishment message and show little interest in international causes. As with cyber crime actors, Brazilian hacktivists face comparatively low risk of law enforcement efforts combatting their activity, and are thus less concerned with hiding their true identities. Recent political and economic crises have triggered widespread protests surrounding a number of different issues, and we have observed Brazilian hacktivists supporting physical protests with associated cyber threat activity. High-profile events have also been a magnet for Brazilian hacktivists; the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, for example, will likely be a key target for hacktivists voicing opposition to the expenses and alleged corruption surrounding the event, and Olympics-related campaigns have already begun. In February 2016, actors participating in the #OpOlympicHacking campaign targeted multiple Brazilian Government and corporate websites with data leak and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Similarly, the 2014 World Cup in Brazil provoked multiple low-impact attacks, with actors regularly targeting poorly protected domains related to highâ\x80\x90profile entities including Brazilian government and corporate organizations. Additionally, Brazilian entities are targets of regional and global hacktivist campaigns, and Brazilian hacktivists have also collaborated with other Latin American hacktivist groups such as Anonymous Peru . We expect Anonymous Peru, Anonymous Venezuela and other groups in the region to coordinate with Brazilian actors on some campaigns; for example, we anticipate that these groups may join Brazilian hacktivists in conducting hacktivist activity against the Brazilian Government or corporate sponsors of the 2016 Olympics. The linguistic gap between Brazil\'s Portuguese and the Spanish spoken by the rest of Latin and South America, however, will very likely make coordination between such groups more challenging to undertake and maintain. Additionally, Spanish-speaking groups have thus far not shown significant interest in the #OpOlympicHacking campaign, demonstrating the campaign\'s insular nature.

Ukraine is a major host of cyber crime activity . This activity is performed by native Ukrainian entities and expatriate groups from Russia and other neighboring countries. Many of the factors that have made Russia a primary source of cyber crime (such as the high level of education, high unemployment rate, social norms that legitimize stealing from Western companies, and lack of attention by law enforcement) are also present in Ukraine. The country is a hotbed of credit card fraud rings and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)-for-hire groups. Ukrainian hacktivists are very active, but mostly focused on Russia . Ukrainian hacktivists engage in activities ranging from website defacements, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and social media account compromise to attempts to compromise their opponents' financial assets. We are confident that all of this activity will continue . It is highly unlikely that Ukrainian law enforcement will crack down on cyber crime given probable focus on other domestic priorities and that the ongoing conflict with Russia.

" Cyber espionage and government-sponsored disruptive attacks pose a moderate threat to Romania. Romanian Government, military, and private sector institutions have been targeted by Russian, Chinese, and South Korean espionage groups. We believe that increasing tension between Russia and the West could potentially lead to an escalation in Russian activity. Moreover, given the established diplomatic relationship between Romania and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, increased tensions between North Korea and the U.S. and its allies could lead to an uptick in cyber espionage activity originating from South Korea as well. Cyber criminals routinely compromise Romanian entities and present a moderate threat. We regularly observe multiple malware families targeting Romanian institutions, and have evidence the back-end system of a Romanian bank was compromised. Hacktivism remains a low threat to Romania. We continue to observe some hacktivist activity occasionally targeting Romanian entities, and we have observed a few Romanian individuals partaking in hacktivist incidents as well, including data leaks and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Romania's domestic cyber crime landscape includes virtually every type of criminal activity imaginable and poses a substantial threat to the international community.

" FireEye Intelligence assesses with high confidence that espionage operations will continue to pose a significant threat to organizations and individuals in Israel, particularly those associated with government, defense industrial base (DIB), technology, and information security industries. Espionage linked to Iranian and Palestinian groups are likely to be of particular note, though Chinese and Russian groups have also been observed targeting Israel. Financially motivated threat activity is almost certainly a near-constant threat to a wide variety of organizations and individuals in Israel, though in many cases it is likely relatively low impact particularly if security best standards are followed. FireEye Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that the threat to Israeli organizations and individuals from cyber crime is largely similar to that faced by entities in other developed nations. Israel is a common target for hacktivist campaigns, and multiple hacktivist actors and groups routinely target Israeli entities. As many of these campaigns are motivated by pro-Palestine, pro-Islam, and anti-Israel sentiment, all of which are related to persistent geopolitical and religious tensions in the region and globally, FireEye Intelligence expects that hacktivism targeting Israel will continue for the foreseeable future.

At least some GCC member states have been reported to have some degree of offensive capabilities. Iran-linked information operations have been observed during the course of 2018, referencing a variety of countries and organizations, including some GCC member states. We suspect that at least some GCC member states possess or are developing information operations capabilities, at least in part due to the ongoing diplomatic tensions following the 2017 Qatar News Agency compromise. We assess with high confidence that financially motivated threat activity is a high-volume threat to organizations and individuals in GCC countries, as it is in other developed countries. We have observed a variety of cyber crime activity affecting organizations and individuals, ranging from widely distributed malware families affecting organizations in the GCC to actors selling access to systems at companies operating in the region. Hacktivist campaigns and groups targeting both public and private entities operating in the GCC have been relatively common in the past, and we assess with moderate confidence that they will continue to be for the foreseeable future.

" Most of the discourse around nation-state cyber operations focuses on cyber espionage or disruptive operations against critical infrastructure; however, individuals are almost certainly becoming a more appealing target vector for nation-states because individual targeting can now be done at a large scale and without as much risk of blowback. ""Mass targeting"" is no longer an oxymoron because nation-states could identify new targets in large tranches of personally identifiable information (PII), use refined data analytic capabilities to prioritize whom to pursue, and quickly develop customized cyber operations to harass or coerce individuals to do their bidding. Furthermore, targeting individuals instead of traditional high-profile targets would exploit a gap in many countries' cyber policies where individuals who are often less protected to start with are left to defend themselves without recourse against these cyber operations.

" Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that cyber espionage presents a high-frequency, high-severity threat to the energy and utilities sectors. Espionage actors may target energy and utility entities in order to defend their economic interests by seeking information related to business operations, new processes and technologies, and mergers and acquisitions; they may also seek to target entities in these categories that constitute critical infrastructure for military or political advantage. We believe the energy and utilities sectors are at increased risk of disruptive and destructive threats, particularly from nation-state actors from Russia and Iran, who have demonstrated the capabilities and intent to conduct such attacks. We assess with high confidence that financially motivated threat activity poses a moderate-frequency, moderate-intensity threat to energy and utility companies. Disruptive financial threats, such as ransomware, pose a notable threat to critical infrastructure operations.

" Cyber espionage is a significant threat to public and private organizations in Israel, including government, defense, academia, aerospace, and infrastructure providers. Threat vectors include spear phishing and watering holes, and most of the observed activity originates from Iran- or China-based actors. While Iran seeks political and military intelligence, China seeks information on regional politics and security and defense technologies for military modernization, as well as intellectual property to benefit domestic industry. Other actors include Middle Eastern groups seeking information on regional security and the Israel-Gaza conflict, and Russia conducting global reconnaissance. Financially motivated cyber crime is a threat affecting industries including finance, energy, and media through threat vectors including credential theft, laundering, ransomware, insider threats, and ATM exploitation. Hacktivist activity targeting Israel is common , primarily by foreign actors opposing Israeli policies and rhetoric on political, religious, and human rights grounds. Actors include ISIS affiliates, Palestinians, Iranians, Pakistanis, Lebanese, and Bangladeshis. Targets include government, defense, nuclear energy, and academia, though anti-Israel hacktivists often consider all websites on Israeli web servers or involving the Jewish diaspora as legitimate targets. Israel enforces relatively lenient data protection regulations. Israel permits cross-border data transfer, does not require data breach notification to victims or authorities, and does not enforce minimum data security standards for database controllers. Israel will continue to make progress aligning its export controls with global implementations of the 2013 Wassenaar Agreement on Intrusion and Surveillance Items, which imposes international standards for subjecting cyber security tools to export controls to reduce the proliferation of dual-use technologies used by malicious actors . Prior to the agreement, Israel, though not a Wassenaar signatory, had committed to fully importing Wassenaar's language into national export controls, resulting in Israel being automatically bound by the ambiguous text of the 2013 agreement. However, in mid-2016, Israel announced plans to liberalize its export controls through measures including a presumption of approval for exporters and periodic review of international Wassenaar implementation to synchronize national controls with global practices.

" Executive Summary Cyber espionage operations from Russia are highly active and are conducting aggressive campaigns against targets in line with Russian strategic and tactical interests. Russian information operations are actively used to influence foreign elections, political processes, and opinions regarding various issues ; observed examples of these campaigns include operations masquerading as pro-Islamic State hacktivist groups, anti-establishment hacktivist groups, news agencies, and political organizations. These campaigns were active in attempting to influence the global narrative around events such as the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and the 2016 Olympic Games. Cyber crime operations conducted by Russian actors remain a significant threat to many organizations, particularly in Western countries, and this activity has affected organizations ranging in size from small local financial organizations to large multinational corporations. Common types of activity by Russian cyber criminals include a wide variety of criminal activity, such as personal data theft, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, financial fraud, money laundering, and ransomware use. Hacktivism conducted by Russian actors is typically politically motivated; Russian organizations, the government, and local media outlets are often targeted by both foreign and domestic hacktivists in response to perceived physical or political aggression by the Russian Government. Russian laws and policies, including extradition laws and domestic monitoring, may have an impact on how foreign organizations operate within Russia. Restrictions on extradition of Russian citizens from the country significantly limit cooperation for investigations into cyber incidents and have led to conflict between Russian and U.S. authorities. Additionally, Russian internet monitoring and censorship are more significant than in many Western nations. ",['No ttp provided'],Turla Team

" Cyber espionage activity poses a moderate to high threat to Austria, as organizations in the country have been observed being targeted by espionage groups in Russia, China, and Iran . Austrian infrastructure has been abused by known espionage actors in recent years. Cyber crime poses a similar threat to Austria as it does to other Central European nations, with frequent but opportunistically targeted incidents . Data theft, financial fraud, malware distribution, and ransomware campaigns commonly affect Austrian individuals and organizations. Malware used in campaigns targeting Austria include Emotet, Dridex, Rovnix, and Mazar. Hacktivism poses a low threat to the Austrian Government and Austria-based operations by commercial enterprises . Though we have observed limited instances of hacktivist targeting of Austrian organizations, primarily with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, these have been limited in scope and relatively infrequent. As a hub for headquarters and branch offices of international organizations, Austria faces an increased baseline level of cyber threat activity compared to many of its neighbors . This increased threat would likely focus on government and international organizations and their employees, but could also lead to collateral damage affecting other organizations and individuals.

" Cyber-enabled operations threaten Command and Control (C C) for conventional military and nuclear weapons, which includes the arrangement of information management, personnel, training, doctrine, equipment, communications, and facilities necessary for operations. Primary threats to C C include espionage and asymmetric warfare, the latter of which includes targeting C C to degrade military forces by sabotaging networks that govern weapons systems, communications, energy, or transportation. A key asymmetric warfare threat is misinformation operations. Actors may seek to cause unintended weapons launch or detonation through misinformation operations, employing methods such as spoofing early warning systems into detecting that an attack is underway or sending fraudulent launch orders to commanders and defense systems. Early warning systems are C C components that would likely be targeted for asymmetric warfare via misinformation operations. Cyber threats to C C may influence proliferation, escalation, and deterrence. Actors may not only compromise internet connected C C systems, but also air-gapped systems through USB-delivered malware, supply chain alteration, and insider-enabled operations. Known conventional and nuclear C C vulnerabilities include: Communications systems vulnerabilities, including satellite jamming and undersea cable compromise Vulnerabilities in outdated systems or in complex, digitized systems Sharing conventional and nuclear C C Insufficient cybersecurity Governments are recognizing cyber threats to C C and are taking steps to increase C C security through several measures, including: Incorporating cyber attacks into wargames, increasing their cyber defense budgets, and strengthening public-private collaboration Creating supply chain risk management strategies Diversifying retaliation measures, including segmentation to ensure survivable systems other than nuclear infrastructure Improving counterintelligence operations ",['No ttp provided'],Turla Team

We believe that a successful compromise of adversary-controlled assets could provide valuable insight into an adversary's behavior and tools, which might facilitate future offensive and defensive efforts. It is possible that evolving cyber norms , including policy changes, leaks exposing nation-state operations, and the influence of private cyber security and malware vendors, will increase the frequency of state-on-state compromise attempts and the frequency with which this type of operation becomes public knowledge. FireEye Threat Intelligence surmises that the primary way in which state-on-state compromise might impact most network defenders would be in impeding attribution with false flag operations or other denial and deception tactics.

" Observed trends in average time between patch issuance and observed exploitation (""time to exploit"") emphasizes that malicious actors are able to exploit vulnerabilities in an extremely short time frame and demonstrates the importance of applying patches as quickly as is feasible. A majority (58 percent) of the vulnerabilities observed to be exploited Q1 2018 Q3 2019 were exploited before a patch was available and are considered to be zero-days. If outliers are excluded, the average time to exploit was around -3 days. Of incidents where vulnerabilities that were successfully exploited for the first time after a patch had been released, more than a quarter (28 percent) occurred within the first week; an additional 36 percent occurred within one month. We assess with high confidence that the availability of either proof-of-concept (PoC) or exploit code alone does not account for time to exploit or likelihood of attempted exploitation without taking into account other factors. We believe that publication of PoC or exploit code increases the potential number of malicious actors able to leverage the vulnerability and indicates a higher level of interest in the vulnerability. We recommend using this information to better prioritize patching schedules for an organization depending on known active threats. Additionally, prioritizing patches for products that are commonly impacted and that have been deployed in an organization's enterprise environment may help to mitigate the risk of a large portion of malicious activity.

We have tracked and profiled these groups through our investigations, endpoint and network detections, and continuous monitoring, allowing us to understand the groups' malware, operational changes, and motivations. This intelligence has been critical to protecting our clients and exposing this threat. We first publicly attributed APT28 to the Russian Government in a report released in October 2014 ( link ).

FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has only observed suspected China-nexus targeting of Belarus that can be directly connected to Zapad 2017. However, various Russia-nexus threat actors have also conducted cyber operations before, during, and after the exercise that could have been used for intelligence collection related to the event. Russia likely views Zapad 2017 as a success, not only for testing and demonstrating military capability, but also as an effective part of its overall information warfare strategy.

Organizations making statements condemning Russian aggression and/or supporting Ukraine and organizations taking actions to restrict Russian participation in international commerce, competitions, and events face elevated risk of future reprisal. We assess that Sandworm and UNC2589 are two of the most likely actors to conduct cyber attacks in retaliation, although we judge that all high-profile Russian threat actors will continue or increase cyber espionage to enhance decision advantage against Ukrainian and NATO government targets.

" Russian cyber operations in the Middle East will likely continue to focus on espionage against regional government, military, energy, and science and technology targets. Russia may also combine its espionage activities with false-front hacktivism mainly targeting defense and media pursuant to Moscow's hybrid warfare strategy. Under this strategy, Moscow uses a blend of conventional arms, special operations forces, and cyber activities to achieve foreign policy goals while deliberately blurring the line between war and peacetime through aggressive operations that, individually, are not serious enough to provoke a full military response. Russia may seek information pertaining to regional armed conflicts, energy production, the political and military activities of the U.S. and its allies, defense-related science and technology, and protection of Russian assets. Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for these operations may include compromising undersea telecommunications cables, compromising air-gapped networks through USB malware or insider threat operations, using satellite-based command and control (C C), engaging in fourth-party intelligence collection, and conducting Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijacking. Moscow's information operations blur the line between espionage and hacktivism and are intended to influence targets' decision-making by controlling access to, and content of, news and other available information sources.

" Changes in political leadership, particularly following contentious elections, often lead to increased espionage activity targeting new administrations. There are several plausible sets of activity from espionage actors associated with U.S. rivals targeting U.S. Government and corporate organizations. Russian actors may be emboldened by the success of their information operations during the election and increase their targeting of the U.S., before and after the new administration takes power. Chinese responses to possible U.S. trade protectionism could lead to increased targeting of U.S. trade organizations and policy makers, and it is plausible that the early days of the new administration will see increased targeting of companies for intellectual property theft as China tests the limits of the new administration's willingness to respond to this activity. Iranian concerns over the future of the Iran-U.S. nuclear agreement could be a driver for espionage targeting policy makers. Should the agreement be nullified, Iranian espionage groups could potentially retaliate with various types of attacks. North Korean activity as a means of testing limits are plausible, but may be delayed until it becomes clear whether overtures during the presidential campaign regarding potential political meetings come to fruition.

" Mandiant Threat Intelligence suggests that the expedient implementation of emergency preparedness measures generates compounding benefits for organizations beyond the immediate goal of improving defenses against an imminent threat. In early 2020, Iranian general Qasem Soleimani's death in a U.S. airstrike led Mandiant to advise organizations to prepare for potential retaliatory Iranian cyber threat activity. Specifically, we suggested prioritizing detection of the initial stages of intrusions and implementing mitigations against commonly observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) Iranian espionage actors employ. Although we have not observed a dramatic increase in the frequency of Iranian operations or significant destructive operations targeting the U.S. or its allies as of July 2021, we suggest that organizations that implemented recommended countermeasures are not only better prepared to defend against potential Iranian activity, but they are also better prepared to counter threat activity from numerous additional threat actors who employ the same or similar TTPs. We expect that these TTPs will remain popular among diverse threat actors for at least the near to mid-term due to their proven effectiveness.

We have also observed limited examples of direct cooperative relationships between states and cyber criminals. Many industries face threats from both financially motivated and espionage actors, and the appropriation and use of cyber criminal tools by state actors, whether publicly available tools or those found in underground markets, can complicate attribution efforts by victims. States will continue to seek out ways to reduce development costs, bolster target reconnaissance, and obtain expertise, which includes leveraging cyber criminals through partnerships and recruitment efforts. As cyber criminals become more sophisticated, states will increasingly benefit from interaction with the cyber crime market.

Hacktivism is a common threat affecting industries including finance, academia, government, and government affiliates in defense, telecom, postal services, information technology (IT), and natural resources. The South African Government can mandate business assistance with communications monitoring, including decryption, and may be conducting domestic surveillance without proper oversight. The country prohibits telecom systems that cannot be monitored, mandates that telecom companies retain data for three to 5 years, and can require encryption key holders to either disclose keys or assist with decryption. South Africa has subscribed to third-party domestic surveillance tool FinFisher, and the government has acknowledged that it collects cell phone metadata with ""stingray"" cell site simulators.

Iran pursues targets in the country for intellectual property theft and strategic and tactical intelligence gathering, and stealing sensitive political or diplomatic information. Pakistan has targeted Turkish media to expand its global surveillance. Cyber crime is prevalent in Turkey , mostly focused on domestic entities and generally involving selling credit card data, spamming services, skimming tools, credential theft and ransomware, and commonly targeting financial institutions. Hacktivism poses a major threat in Turkey. Turkish anti-government hacktivist actors usually target government entities, energy, finance, health care, and corporate entities that are perceived to be colluding with the Turkish Government, transportation sectors, and, in rare cases, have targeted foreign entities. Turkish nationalist hacktivists on the other hand have targeted domestic and international targets that threaten their nationalist ideology, Turkish culture, and Islam. Turkey's new data protection law is close to European Union (EU) data protection law. This law restricts corporate data collection and use while affording the government widespread surveillance authority. Turkey conducts warrantless data collection, monitors and blocks websites, including high-profile social networking services, and can allegedly bypass end-to-end encryption on communication applications. By contrast, corporations generally need explicit permission from clients or the government for processing personal data and transferring such data to third parties or outside Turkey. Cyber threats to business operations in Turkey could worsen as Turkey expands its nuclear program and business dealings with China, along with increased tension domestically and with Russia.

" Cyber crime is responsible for most attacks directed against hospitality companies. Cyber criminals use several methods to capitalize on a successful attack, theft of payment and sensitive data, and extortive attacks. The cyber espionage threat to the hospitality industry is dependent on the company's location and its political and social environment. Nation-state actors increasingly target the sector to collect information on hotel guests of interest, gather corporate information, and conduct destructive attacks. Hacktivism poses a minor threat to organizations in the hospitality industry. Targeting of entities in the hospitality sector primarily occurs opportunistically or as part of broader campaigns against multiple targets.

" The cyber espionage threat to the hospitality industry is uneven, with moderate risk in many locations, but very high risk throughout Europe and many major cities worldwide. Nation-state actors are increasingly targeting the sector to infect high-profile customers, supplementing long-standing risks to corporate information and, in one case, conducting a destructive attack. Hospitality companies face a very high level of cyber crime; it is the most common cyber risk to the industry. Advanced criminal groups consistently target the sector with point of sale (POS) and backdoor malware likely due to the vast amounts of consumer financial data vulnerable to theft in the industry. Extortive attacks have also been observed. Hacktivism poses a minor threat to organizations in the hospitality industry. Targeting is mostly opportunistic and connected to broader themes. Hospitality industry companies are a source and victim of supply chain and third-party attacks. Hospitality companies should adopt robust controls and use available intelligence to mitigate supply chain threats and avoid being the abused third party themselves. In isolated cases, critical infrastructure reliance can affect hospitality industry risk, such as when hazardous sewage was released on the property of an Australian hotel after an ICS insider attack. Digital transformation efforts in many companies in the hospitality industry will broaden the threat landscape and introduce new cyber risks. Connected gaming, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and industrial control systems (ICS) integration require forward-thinking security programs. ",['No ttp provided'],APT28

Financially motivated threat activity is almost certainly a near-constant threat to a wide variety of organizations and individuals in Israel, though in many cases it is likely relatively low impact particularly if security best standards are followed. FireEye Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that the threat to Israeli organizations and individuals from cyber crime is largely similar to that faced by entities in other developed nations. Israel is a common target for hacktivist campaigns, and multiple hacktivist actors and groups routinely target Israeli entities. As many of these campaigns are motivated by pro-Palestine, pro-Islam, and anti-Israel sentiment, all of which are related to persistent geopolitical and religious tensions in the region and globally, FireEye Intelligence expects that hacktivism targeting Israel will continue for the foreseeable future.

Cyber crime is frequent in Singapore , ranging from credential theft and money laundering to data breaches and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. China is the most common source of financially motivated cyber crime in Singapore. Hacktivist activity in Singapore is rare . There are effectively no domestic hacktivist movements, and hacktivism by foreign actors (such as various Anonymous operations) occurs only occasionally, typically in response to perceived political or legal controversies in Singapore related to internet freedom or regional political disputes. The Government of Singapore conducts electronic and physical surveillance much more aggressively than is common in Western nations . Singapore monitors internet communications at the service provider and potentially business and individual levels. The government has recently begun cracking down on violators of anti-money laundering regulations, making compliance with those laws particularly important. Cyber threats to business operations in Singapore could worsen as part of broad, regional political disputes in which Singapore becomes involved . Territorial and legal disputes in the region could lead nation-states to sponsor more aggressive cyber espionage campaigns or hacktivists to launch cyber attacks on businesses operating in Singapore.

Most observed espionage activity originates in Iran, which has emphasized operations against Saudi targets during the past year to support military and strategic decision making, including critical infrastructure exploitation. To a lesser extent, China targets the region as part of its global campaigns to collect data on political, military, and economic issues, in addition to intellectual property theft. Cyber crime frequently targets Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states for credential theft and ransomware operations. Typical cyber crime is unsophisticated, but successful due to poor regional security postures that include a lack of sufficient corporate security measures, regulatory standards, and law enforcement capabilities. Hacktivism commonly affects GCC states and originates from a combination of regional and global actors, with the majority of actors residing in the Middle East. Targets are primarily governments and perceived government affiliates, including those in energy, finance, media, and telecommunications.

Information operations pose a regular frequency, moderate intensity threat to German entities, with observed activity tied to Russian and Iranian actors seeking to influence public opinion in line with respective national strategic interests. Financially motivated cyber crime continues to pose a regular frequency, serious intensity threat to Germany, a country with a high level of wealth and technological advancement. Frequently observed activities include widespread phishing campaigns, point-of-sale (POS) malware propagation, personal or corporate data theft, and sale of network accesses. Given its geopolitical importance in Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), its relative wealth, and industrial base including numerous high-tech, automotive, manufacturing, and other corporations Germany will continue to be an attractive target for espionage and information operations, financially motivated threats, and a target for potential disruptive and destructive attacks.

" In early October 2017, FireEye devices detected APT28 targeting European diplomats, particularly those focused on cyber defense and policy, with spear-phishing emails containing an updated version of GAMEFISH (Sofacy). The backdoor is most commonly dropped via Microsoft Office vulnerabilities, macros, and Flash vulnerabilities. The security protocol used to secure most wireless computer networks has been cracked. The attack exploits Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2), an industry standard for wireless network security, to intercept wireless network traffic and potentially allow a threat actor to inject their own malicious traffic in ways that users would probably not detect. FireEye has detected several new North Korean campaigns targeting large financial institutions in East Asia and possibly important parts of the global financial system. Three new vulnerabilities affecting Apache Tomcat (CVE-2017-12617), Apache Solr (CVE-2017-12629), and Microsoft Word (CVE-2017-11826) were added to this week's Weekly Vulnerability Exploitation Report due to the potential for arbitrary code execution and observed actor interest in weaponization. A flaw affecting RSA Library version 1.02.013 has been discovered, undermining the security of millions of encryption keys used in a variety of devices, such as national identity cards and software and application signing. Microsoft, Google, HP, Lenovo, and Fujitsu products are affected but have released either updates or mitigation guidelines. On Oct. 17, 2017, actor ""40gradusov"" advertised a one-day Adobe Flash remote code execution exploit (CVE-2017-11292) on a prominent Russian-language underground forum for $15,000 USD. The messaging app Telegram has been fined by the Russian Government for refusing a request to provide the Russian State Security Organization (FSB) with access to encrypted conversations within the app. The company's founder noted that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had made a similar request.

" Executive Summary Cyber espionage operations from Russia are highly active and are conducting aggressive campaigns against targets in line with Russian strategic and tactical interests. Russian information operations are actively used to influence foreign elections, political processes, and opinions regarding various issues ; observed examples of these campaigns include operations masquerading as pro-Islamic State hacktivist groups, anti-establishment hacktivist groups, news agencies, and political organizations. These campaigns were active in attempting to influence the global narrative around events such as the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and the 2016 Olympic Games. Cyber crime operations conducted by Russian actors remain a significant threat to many organizations, particularly in Western countries, and this activity has affected organizations ranging in size from small local financial organizations to large multinational corporations. Common types of activity by Russian cyber criminals include a wide variety of criminal activity, such as personal data theft, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, financial fraud, money laundering, and ransomware use. Hacktivism conducted by Russian actors is typically politically motivated; Russian organizations, the government, and local media outlets are often targeted by both foreign and domestic hacktivists in response to perceived physical or political aggression by the Russian Government. Russian laws and policies, including extradition laws and domestic monitoring, may have an impact on how foreign organizations operate within Russia. Restrictions on extradition of Russian citizens from the country significantly limit cooperation for investigations into cyber incidents and have led to conflict between Russian and U.S. authorities. Additionally, Russian internet monitoring and censorship are more significant than in many Western nations. ",['No ttp provided'],APT28
" The threat of cyber espionage facing Finland is high. Russia, China, and Iran-nexus attackers have been observed targeting Finnish corporations and government agencies. Finland is a target for cyber crime, but domestic efforts have been relatively successful in curbing the threat. Financial institutions are the primary target, and various kinds of Trojans, info-stealers, and ransomware are among the observed malware. The risk to Finnish organizations posed by hacktivism is low. Some impactful distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have been observed; other operations have fizzled. The cyber dimension of Russia's geostrategic activism constitutes a significant threat to Finland. The country will likely continue to make political, diplomatic, and technological investments to mitigate the threat of Russian hybrid warfare. Finland's national cyber capability will likely advance substantially in the upcoming years if the country adopts a long-awaited yet domestically controversial intelligence law. The law is in the final stages of gathering input from various stakeholders, and it is likely to be passed in the second half of 2017 or the first half of 2018. ",['No ttp provided'],APT28

" Cyber espionage is a threat that targets public and private organizations in Poland. Targets include government, defense, energy, and research institutions. Russia has conducted most observed activity, likely to gather intelligence on government, defense, diplomatic affairs, and for intellectual property. Cyber crime is common in Poland , with activity including compromise of bank accounts, payment cards, business email, automatic teller machines (ATMs), credential theft, and ransomware. Hacktivist activity targets Polish industries including government, finance, defense, law enforcement, and telecommunications. Threat vectors include distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and data leaks. Much observed activity is from Russian state-sponsored hacktivist personas targeting Poland for its perceived antagonism toward Russia's national interests, including support for the Ukrainian Government, criticism of confident and expansive Russian foreign policy, and positioning troops along its eastern border in light of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Russian information operations may implicate Poland . Russia perceives the former Soviet bloc nation as an opponent, partially owing to historic enmity, favorable Polish-Ukrainian relations, and Poland's instrumentality in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), an organization that Moscow labels a threat to Russia's interests. We believe that in addition to conducting espionage against Poland with an actor sanctioned for information operations, Moscow employed a Ukrainian-nationalist persona to target Polish defense and government and used a Polish persona to target the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Recent legislation gives the Polish Government broad surveillance and internet control authority. Recently adopted antiterrorism and surveillance bills permit the government, which has previously subscribed to third-party surveillance company ""Hacking Team,"" to collect internet and telecommunications data of citizens without court approval. Also without judicial approval, the government may block websites, and during a state of emergency, it may disable all communications in a given area. ",['No ttp provided'],APT28

" Cyber espionage poses a long-term and significant threat to both public and private organizations in Singapore . FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has consistently observed groups associated with China and Russia targeting assets in Singapore, likely for economic espionage, intellectual property theft, and strategic and tactical intelligence gathering. Cyber crime activity affecting organizations and individuals Singapore is common , ranging from credential theft and money laundering activity to data breaches, ransomware, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. While Singapore is likely impacted by opportunistic global cyber crime in general, the most common source for cyber crime activity affecting Singapore is Chinese actors. Hacktivism targeting or originating from Singapore is rare . There are effectively no domestic hacktivist movements, and hacktivism by foreign actors (such as various ""Anonymous"" operations) occurs only occasionally, typically in response to perceived political or legal controversies in Singapore related to internet freedom or regional political disputes. Occasional targeting of organizations in Singapore, such as banks, occur as part of global campaigns targeting industries rather than organizations in specific countries. The Government of Singapore conducts domestic electronic and physical surveillance more aggressively than is common in Western nations, and they could increasingly turn these capabilities against their neighbors and other foreign targets. Singapore monitors internet communications at the service provider and potentially business and individual levels. The government has been cracking down on violators of anti-money laundering regulations for the past several years, making compliance with those laws particularly important. Threats to organizations and individuals in Singapore will likely increase when Singapore takes over as Chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2018. Territorial and legal disputes in the region could lead nation-states to sponsor more aggressive cyber espionage campaigns or hacktivists to launch cyber attacks on businesses operating in Singapore. The Government of Singapore typically stays neutral in many regional political disputes, but may be forced to take a stronger stance on provocative issues when it takes over as Chairman of ASEAN.

Rather than sophistication, cyber espionage is distinguished by motivation. Cyber espionage actors range from the amateurish to the incredibly sophisticated, but they all have a desire to obtain information that can be exploited to a competitive advantage. These actors are seeking intelligence on diplomacy or military affairs, dissidents or global economic conditions. Increasingly, they are also seeking intelligence on economic competitors. This intelligence is different from the commodity financial data that criminals seek and sell on the black market because it is not interchangeable. It has value to limited recipients, almost always nation-states, though proving their involvement is a difficult task.

" From January 2019 to June 2021, Mandiant Threat Intelligence observed evidence of at least eight espionage clusters linked to Iran, China, and Russia, as well as operations deploying at least 10 different ransomware families, exploit 20 specific vulnerabilities in VPN software from seven different vendors. CVE-2019-19781, CVE-2019-11510, and CVE-2018-13379 were exploited by the largest number of separate activity clusters, at least 13, 12, and 10, respectively. Suspected APT5 and UNC757 were the most prolific actors, exploiting six and five VPN vulnerabilities, respectively. We continued to observe new reports of exploitation of most of these vulnerabilities well after the initial waves of disclosures and exploitations, indicating that delays in patching compound the risk that unpatched or unmitigated software will be exploited. We assess with moderate confidence that the primary driver behind VPN exploitation remains the unique, powerful, and efficient utility of a flaw in a VPN gateway to accomplish a variety of attacker goals.

" Mandiant Threat Intelligence analyzed 38 vulnerabilities that were exploited in incidents ultimately resulting in ransomware deployment from early 2019 to the end of July 2021. Fifteen of these vulnerabilities were zero-days at the time of exploitation. We observed 20 distinct ransomware families associated with these vulnerabilities. SODINOKIBI operations by far exploited the most vulnerabilities compared to other operations: 12 distinct vulnerabilities, eight of which were zero-days at the time of exploitation. The consistent use of vulnerability exploitation to ultimately deploy ransomware from early 2019 to July 2021 leads us to judge that threat actors will continue to leverage vulnerabilities in ransomware operations for at least the near to mid-term.

" The number of zero-days exploited as of July 2021 is on track to more than double the previous record volume from 2019 and has already surpassed all previous years on record. State-sponsored groups continue to be the primary actors exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, although the proportion of financially motivated actors deploying zero-day exploits has grown significantly since 2019. Microsoft's Exchange and Windows Server software, Apple's iOS, and Google's Chrome browser had the highest volume of zero-days exploited by threat actors, likely reflecting the popularity of these products. The vast increase in zero-day exploitation in 2021, as well as the diversification in motives and actors using them, expands the risk portfolio for organizations in nearly every industry sector and geography, particularly those that rely on these popular systems.

Mandiant documented a dramatic increase in zero-day exploitation in 2021. We also observed numerous significant campaigns in which threat actors exploited vulnerabilities in VPNs as a means to gain initial access to victim networks. Patterns in frequently exploited software have shifted in 2020 and 2021 with threat actors exploiting products, such as VPN technologies and file transfer applications, which have not historically been among the most frequently exploited products. Mobile vulnerability exploitation also appears to have increased. Chinese, Russian, and Iranian state-sponsored actors continue to exploit vulnerabilities as part of their campaigns.

" In early 2021, UNC2447 exploited a zero-day vulnerability in certain unpatched SonicWall VPN appliances to obtain access to victim networks and subsequently deploy FIVEHANDS ransomware. FIVEHANDS has significant technical overlaps with DEATHRANSOM and HELLOKITTY ransomware.

It is possible that these actors are associated with FIVEHANDS activity, given technical and operational overlaps between the malware families. Mandiant Threat Intelligence anticipates that financially motivated actors will continue to incorporate zero-day and one-day (i.e., private, but patched) exploits into their operations since these exploits could be effective against high-value targets and may increase operational efficiency.

"["" This content was published to the FireEye Blog on April 22, 2019, and is largely based on information previously published to the FireEye Threat Intelligence portal in the report Technical Analysis: Carbanak Source Code and Related Binaries (Sept. 14, 2018.) Threat Detail It is very unusual for FLARE to analyze a prolifically used, privately developed backdoor only to later have the source code and operator tools fall into our laps. Yet this is the extraordinary circumstance that sets the stage for CARBANAK Week, a four-part blog series that commences with this post. CARBANAK is one of the most full-featured backdoors around. It was used to perpetrate millions of dollars in financial crimes, largely by the group we track as FIN7 . In 2017, Tom Bennett and Barry Vengerik published Behind the CARBANAK Backdoor , which was the product of a deep and broad analysis of CARBANAK samples and FIN7 activity across several years. On the heels of that publication, Nick Carr uncovered a pair of RAR archives containing CARBANAK source code, builders, and other tools (both available in VirusTotal: kb3r1p and apwmie ). FLARE malware analysis requests are typically limited to a few dozen files at most. But the CARBANAK source code was 20MB comprising 755 files, with 39 binaries and 100,000 lines of code. Our goal was to find threat intelligence we missed in our previous analyses. How does an analyst respond to a request with such breadth and open-ended scope? And what did we find? My friend Tom Bennett and I spoke about this briefly in our 2018 FireEye Cyber Defense Summit talk, Hello, Carbanak! In this blog series, we will expound at length and share a written retrospective on the inferences drawn in our previous public analysis based on binary code reverse engineering. In this episode, I'll discuss Russian language concerns, translated graphical user interfaces of CARBANAK tools, and anti-analysis tactics as seen from a source code perspective. We will also explain an interesting twist where analyzing the source code surprisingly proved to be just as difficult as analyzing the binary, if not more. There's a lot here; buckle up! File Encoding and Language Considerations The objective of this analysis was to discover threat intelligence gaps and better protect our customers. To begin, I wanted to assemble a cross-reference of source code files and concepts of specific interest. Reading the source code entailed two steps: displaying the files in the correct encoding and learning enough Russian to be dangerous. Figure 1 shows CARBANAK source code in a text editor that is unaware of the correct encoding. Figure 1 : File without proper decoding Two good file encoding guesses are UTF-8 and code page 1251 (Cyrillic). The files were mostly code page 1251 as shown in Figure 2 . Figure 2 : Code Page 1251 (Cyrillic) source code The previous file is a C++ header file defining error values involved in backdoor command execution. Most identifiers were in English, but some were not particularly descriptive. Ergo, the second and more difficult step was learning some Russian to benefit from the context offered by the source code comments. FLARE has fluent Russian speakers, but I took it upon myself to minimize my use of other analysts' time. To this end, I wrote a script to tear through files and create a prioritized vocabulary list. The script, shown in Figure 3 , walks source directories finding all character sequences outside the printable lower ASCII range (decimal values 32-126 inclusive). The script adds each word to a Python defaultdictand increments its count. Finally, the script orders this dictionary by frequency of occurrence and dumps it to a file. Figure 3 : Vocabulary ripper script The result was a 3,400+ word vocabulary list, partially shown in Figure 4 . Figure 4 : Top 19 Cyrillic character sequences from the CARBANAK source code I spent several hours on Russian language learning websites to study the pronunciation of Cyrillic characters and Russian words. Then, I looked up the top 600+ words and created a small dictionary. I added Russian language input to an analysis VM and used Microsoft's on-screen keyboard (osk.exe) to navigate the Cyrillic keyboard layout and look up definitions. One helpful effect of learning to pronounce Cyrillic characters was my newfound recognition of English loan words. My small vocabulary allowed me to read many comments without looking anything up. Table 1 shows a short sampling of some of the English loan words I encountered. Cyrillic English Phonetic English Occurrences Rank Ð¤Ð°Ð¹Ð» f ah y L file 224 5 Ñ\x81ÐµÑ\x80Ð²ÐµÑ\x80 s e r v e r server 145 13 Ð°Ð´Ñ\x80ÐµÑ\x81 a d r e s address 52 134 ÐºÐ¾Ð¼Ð°Ð½Ð´ k o m a n d command 110+ 27 Ð±Ð¾Ñ\x82Ð° b o t a bot 130 32 Ð¿Ð»Ð°Ð³Ð¸Ð½ p l ah g ee n plugin 116 39 Ñ\x81ÐµÑ\x80Ð²Ð¸Ñ\x81 s e r v ee s service 70 46 Ð¿Ñ\x80Ð¾Ñ\x86ÐµÑ\x81Ñ\x81 p r o ts e s s process 130ish 63 Table 1 : Sampling of English loan words in the CARBANAK source code Aside from source code comments, understanding how to read and type in Cyrillic came in handy for translating the CARBANAK graphical user interfaces I found in the source code dump. Figure 5 shows a command and control (C C) user interface for CARBANAK that I translated. Figure 5 : Translated C C graphical user interface These user interfaces included video management and playback applications as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7 respectively. Tom will share some interesting work he did with these in a subsequent part of this blog series. Figure 6 : Translated video management application user interface Figure 7 : Translated video playback application user interface Figure 8 shows the backdoor builder that was contained within the RAR archive of operator tools. Figure 8 : Translated backdoor builder application user interface The operator RAR archive also contained an operator's manual explaining the semantics of all the backdoor commands. Figure 9 shows the first few commands in this manual, both in Russian and English (translated). Figure 9 : Operator manual (left: original Russian; right: translated to English) Down the Rabbit Hole: When Having Source Code Does Not Help In simpler backdoors, a single function evaluates the command ID received from the C C server and dispatches control to the correct tasking function to carry out the command. For example, a backdoor might ask its C C server for a command and receive a response bearing the command ID 0x67. The dispatch function in the backdoor will check the command ID against several different values, including 0x67, which might, for example, call a function to shovel a reverse shell to the C C server. Figure 10 shows a control flow graph of such a function as viewed in IDA Pro. Each block of code checks against a command ID and either passes control to the appropriate command handling code, or moves on to check for the next command ID. Figure 10 : A control flow graph of a simple command handling function In this regard, CARBANAK is an entirely different beast. It utilizes a Windows mechanism called named pipes as a means of communication and coordination across all the threads, processes, and plugins under the backdoor's control. When the CARBANAK tasking component receives a command, it forwards the command over a named pipe where it travels through several different functions that process the message, possibly writing it to one or more additional named pipes, until it arrives at its destination where the specified command is finally handled. Command handlers may even specify their own named pipe to request more data from the C C server. When the C C server returns the data, CARBANAK writes the result to this auxiliary named pipe and a callback function is triggered to handle the response data asynchronously. CARBANAK's named pipe-based tasking component is flexible enough to control both inherent command handlers and plugins. It also allows for the possibility of a local client to dispatch commands to CARBANAK without the use of a network. In fact, not only did we write such a client in order to aid in analysis and testing, but such a client, named botcmd.exe, was also present in the source dump. Tom's Perspective Analyzing this command-handling mechanism within CARBANAK from a binary perspective was certainly challenging. It required maintaining tabs for many different views into the disassembly, and a sort of textual map of command ids and named pipe names to describe the journey of an inbound command through the various pipes and functions before arriving at its destination. Figure 11 shows the control flow graphs for seven of the named pipe message handling functions. While it was difficult to analyze this from a binary reverse engineering perspective, having compiled code combined with the features that a good disassembler such as IDA Pro provides made it less harrowing than Mike's experience. The binary perspective saved me from having to search across several source files and deal with ambiguous function names. The disassembler features allowed me to easily follow cross-references for functions and global variables and to open multiple, related views into the code. Figure 11 : Control flow graphs for the named pipe message handling functions Mike's Perspective Having source code sounds like god mode for malware analysis. Indeed, source code contains much information that is lost through the compilation and linking process. Even so, CARBANAK's tasking component (for handling commands sent by the C C server) serves as a counter-example. Depending on the C C protocol used and the command being processed, control flow may take divergent paths through different functions only to converge again later and accomplish the same command. Analysis required bouncing around between almost 20 functions in 5 files, often backtracking to recover information about function pointers and parameters that were passed in from as many as 18 layers back. Analysis also entailed resolving matters of C++ class inheritance, scope ambiguity, overloaded functions, and control flow termination upon named pipe usage. The overall effect was that this was difficult to analyze, even in source code. I only embarked on this top-to-bottom journey once, to search for any surprises. The effort gave me an appreciation for the baroque machinery the authors constructed presumably for the sake of obfuscation. I concluded that this was done to obscure relationships and hinder timely analysis. Anti-Analysis Mechanisms in Source Code CARBANAK's executable code is filled with logic that pushes hexadecimal numbers to the same function, followed by an indirect call against the returned value. This is easily recognizable as obfuscated function import resolution, wherein CARBANAK uses a simple string hash known as PJW (named after its author, P.J. Weinberger) to locate Windows API functions without disclosing their names. A Python implementation of the PJW hash is shown in Figure 12 for reference. def pjw_hash(s): ctr = 0 for i in range(len(s)): ctr = 0xffffffff ((ctr 4) + ord(s[i])) if ctr 0xf0000000: ctr = (((ctr 0xf0000000) 24) ^ ctr) 0x0fffffff return ctr Figure 12 : PJW hash This is used several hundred times in CARBANAK samples and impedes understanding of the malware's functionality. Fortunately, reversers can use the flare-ida scripts to annotate the obfuscated imports, as shown in Figure 13 . Figure 13 : Obfuscated import resolution annotated with FLARE's shellcode hash search The CARBANAK authors achieved this obfuscated import resolution throughout their backdoor with relative ease using C preprocessor macros and a pre-compilation source code scanning step to calculate function hashes. Figure 14 shows the definition of the relevant API macro and associated machinery. Figure 14 : API macro for import resolution The API macro allows the author to type API(SHLWAPI, PathFindFileNameA)( ) and have it replaced with GetApiAddrFunc(SHLWAPI, hashPathFindFileNameA)( ). SHLWAPI is a symbolic macro defined to be the constant 3, and hashPathFindFileNameA is the string hash value 0xE3685D1 as observed in the disassembly. But how was the hash defined? The CARBANAK source code has a utility (unimaginatively named tool) that scans source code for invocations of the API macro to build a header file defining string hashes for all the Windows API function names encountered in the entire codebase. Figure 15 shows the source code for this utility along with its output file, api_funcs_hash.h. Figure 15 : Source code and output from string hash utility When I reverse engineer obfuscated malware, I can't help but try theorize about how authors implement their obfuscations. The CARBANAK source code gives another data point into how malware authors wield the powerful C preprocessor along with custom code scanning and code generation tools to obfuscate without imposing an undue burden on developers. This might provide future perspective in terms of what to expect from malware authors in the future and may help identify units of potential code reuse in future projects as well as rate their significance. It would be trivial to apply this to new projects, but with the source code being on VirusTotal, this level of code sharing may not represent shared authorship. Also, the source code is accessibly instructive in why malware would push an integer as well as a hash to resolve functions: because the integer is an index into an array of module handles that are opened in advance and associated with these pre-defined integers. Conclusion The CARBANAK source code is illustrative of how these malware authors addressed some of the practical concerns of obfuscation. Both the tasking code and the Windows API resolution system represent significant investments in throwing malware analysts off the scent of this backdoor.

" This report focuses on highlighting notable overlaps that allowed us to merge eight previously suspected FIN7 threat clusters (""UNCs"") into a FIN7 subgroup as well as the associated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed since our prior public blog in August 2019. Mandiant has observed FIN7 continue to leverage PowerShell throughout its intrusions, including in a new backdoor called POWERPLANT, which FIN7 has continually developed over the last two years. We've also identified new versions of the BIRDWATCH downloader being developed, which we track as CROWVIEW and FOWLGAZE. FIN7's initial access techniques have diversified to include software supply chain compromise and the use of stolen credentials in addition to its traditional phishing techniques. We also observed FIN7 use POWERPLANT as its first-stage malware instead of LOADOUT and/or GRIFFON in newer intrusions. Data theft extortion or ransomware deployment following FIN7-attributed activity at multiple organizations, as well as technical overlaps, suggest that FIN7 actors have been associated with various ransomware operations over time. Mandiant is also tracking multiple, notable campaigns as separate UNC groups that we suspect are FIN7, including a ""BadUSB"" campaign leading to DICELOADER and multiple phishing campaigns leveraging cloud marketing platforms leading to BIRDWATCH.

"[' This content was published to the FireEye Blog on April 23, 2019, and is largely based on information previously published to the FireEye Threat Intelligence portal in the report Technical Analysis: Carbanak Source Code and Related Binaries (Sept. 14, 2018.) Continuing the CARBANAK Source Code Analysis In the previous installment, we wrote about how string hashing was used in CARBANAK to manage Windows API resolution throughout the entire codebase. But the authors used this same string hashing algorithm for another task as well. In this installment, we\'ll pick up where we left off and write about CARBANAK\'s anti-virus detection, anti-virus evasion, authorship artifacts, exploits, secrets, and network-based indicators. Anti-Virus Evasions Source code unquestionably accelerates analysis of string hashes. For example, the function AVDetect in AV.cpp iterates processes to detect anti-virus by process name hash, as shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1 : Anti-virus detection by process name hash What does CARBANAK do with this information? It evades anti-virus according to what is installed. Figure 2 shows the code for an AVG evasion that the authors disabled by commenting it out. Based on this, it appears as if the AVG evasion was retired, but FLARE team member Ryan Warns confirmed in November 2017 that it still worked with one minor tweak. FLARE disclosed this to AVG immediately upon confirming it. Avast indicates that after our disclosure, they updated the affected DLL to ignore DLL_PROCESS_DETACH and left its hooks in place. Figure 2 : Commented out source code to unload AVG user-space hooks In November of 2017, FLARE also disclosed an evasion for Trend Micro\'s detection of process injection that remained active in the CARBANAK source code. The evasion mirrors a technique used in Carberp that replaces remote heap allocation and a call to CreateRemoteThread with memory mapping and queueing of an asynchronous procedure call via QueueUserAPC. Following our disclosure, Trend Micro indicated that they had updated their behavior monitoring rules and released OfficeScan XG SP1 in December 2017 with a new ""Aggressive Event"" detection feature that covers this behavior. Author Characterization Having source code could pose unique opportunities to learn about the individuals behind the keyboard. To that end, I searched for artifacts in the source code dump that might point to individuals. I found the most information in Visual Studio solution files. Most of these referenced drive O: as the source root, but I found the following host paths: C:\\Users\\hakurei reimu\\AppData\\Local\\Temp C:\\Users\\Igor\\AppData\\Local\\Temp E:\\Projects\\progs\\Petrosjan\\WndRec\\... E:\\Projects\\progs\\sbu\\WndRec\\... Unfortunately, these data points don\'t yield many answers. If they are observed in later artifacts, connections might be inferred, but as of this writing, not much else is known about the authors. Source Code Survey The CARBANAK source code contained numerous exploits, previous command and control (C C) hosts, passwords, and key material. I decided to comprehensively search these out and determine if they led to any new conclusions or corroborated any previous observations. Exploits I wanted to know if the CARBANAK authors wielded any exploits that were not publicly disclosed. To the contrary, I found all the exploits to be well documented. Table 1 breaks out the escalation code I reviewed from the CARBANAK source code dump. Name CVE Notes PathRec 2013-3660 Exploit proof-of-concept (PoC) from May 2013 Sdrop 2013-3660 Exploit PoC from June 2013 NDProxy 2013-5065 NDProxy.sys exploit originally authored by secniu UACBypass UAC bypass by DLL hijacking found in Carberp COM UAC bypass by disabling elevation prompts and dialogs via the IFileOperation COM interface CVE-2014-4113 2014-4113 Win32k.sys exploit derived from code that can be found online BlackEnergy2 AppCompat shim-based UAC bypass EUDC 2010-4398 UAC bypass by EUDC exploitation Table 1 : Exploits for elevation found in CARBANAK source code The CARBANAK source code also contains code copied wholesale from Mimikatz including the sekurlsa module for dumping passwords from lsass.exe and Terminal Services patching code to allow multiple remote desktop protocol connections. Secrets My analysis included an audit of passwords and key material found in the source code and accompanying binaries. Although many of these were used for debug versions, I curated them for reference in case a need might arise to guess future passwords based on passwords used in the source code. Table 2 shows recovered passwords used for RC2-encrypted communications and other purposes along with the corresponding name in the source code and their status as they were encountered (active in source code, commented out, or compiled into a binary).

This seemed like it could provide a new network-based indicator to definitively tie operations together or catch new activity. It was trivial to brute force this container by adapting a publicly available code sample of X509 handling in C# to cycle through passwords in a popular password list.

Conclusion Our analysis of this source code dump confirmed it was CARBANAK and turned up a few new and interesting data points. We were able to notify vendors about disclosures that specifically targeted their security suites. The previously documented NBIs, Windows API function resolution, backdoor command hash values, usage of Windows cabinet file APIs, and other artifacts associated with CARBANAK all match, and as they say, if the shoe fits, wear it. Interestingly though, the project itself isn\'t called CARBANAK or even Anunak, as the information security community has come to call it based on the string artifacts found within the malware. The authors mainly refer to the malware as ""bot"" in the Visual Studio project, filenames, source code comments, output binaries, and user interfaces. The breadth and depth of this analysis was a departure from the usual requests we receive on the FLARE team. The journey included learning some Russian, searching through a hundred thousand lines of code for new information, and analyzing a few dozen binaries. In the end, I\'m thankful I had the opportunity to take this request. In the next episode, Tom Bennett takes the reins to provide a retrospective on his and Barry Vengerik\'s previous analysis in light of the source code.

" In the first four months of 2022, Mandiant identified more Russian-sponsored disruptive cyberattacks against Ukraine than it has during the past eight years. Several of these cyberattacks were coupled with concurrent information operations, including manipulation of a TV broadcast and dissemination of a deepfake video impersonating the Ukrainian president falsely announcing Ukraine's surrender. Mandiant suggests that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused some temporary disruption to the Russian-speaking cyber crime ecosystem, such as causing ideological divisions within threat groups and inspiring actors to use cyber capabilities in support of Russia or Ukraine. Mandiant observed numerous hacktivists claim to conduct threat activity in support of Russia or Ukraine. We suggest the conflict brought about a significant resurgence in global hacktivism and/or the use of hacktivist tactics , which had declined in the latter half of the last decade.

" FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence defines Light Rail Transit (LRT) as a subcomponent of the Rail Transportation industry, focused on transporting passengers within urban or suburban areas by a vehicle on rail lines, including light rail trains, trams, and streetcars. LRT systems face potential threats from state-sponsored, financially motivated, hacktivist and terrorist-sympathetic adversaries. Insider threats are also relevant for rail transportation. Potential adverse outcomes of cyber threat activity include destruction of infrastructure, disruption of operations, economic loss, and reputational damage to the LRT system, and by extension, associated municipal or other authorities. The complex dynamics and interdependencies between different layers of rail transportation systems provide attackers with opportunities to perform attacks on a variety of different attack surfaces. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and the supply chain are among the most critical attack vectors. Third-party or external contractors in the supply chain represent risks to the integrity of the LRT system due to shared access to sensitive information and/or equipment required for the system's operation. However, proper precautions can mitigate the risks.

" Under PSD2, data aggregators operate similarly to the intent of Account Information Service Providers (AISPs), which will be allowed to aggregate and present consumer data. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has previously observed actor interest in leveraging data aggregator services for their operations primarily as it relates to account monitoring. In order for financial data aggregators to communicate with financial institutions, usernames and passwords must be decrypted and used to authenticate every ""transaction"" (aka communication) made using Open Financial Exchange (OFX). The dependence on usernames and passwords inherently introduces higher levels of risk for financial institutions and their customers.

" Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that the professionalization and commoditization of the financially motivated cyber threat ecosystem continues to evolve and is primarily driven by criminals' focus on increasing efficiency and profits. Many preexisting criminal markets have shifted to support ransomware operations, which provide an efficient, effective monetization process unlimited by industry or geography. As a result, the interactions between criminal enterprises and victims, so-called customer service interactions, has greatly accelerated, particularly in the last three years. Increased specialization has amplified the risks to organizations from cyber crime, particularly ransomware, since any poorly performing element of the attack lifecycle can be replaced by another ""vendor"" to enhance the efficacy of total operations. This trend has also opened more complex operations to a higher volume of less sophisticated actors and complicated attribution.

Mandiant Threat Intelligence currently tracks multiple threat clusters that have deployed the DARKSIDE ransomware. Consistent with our analysis of broader ransomware incidents, the actors have largely relied on open-source and commercially available attack tools to facilitate stages of the attack lifecycle. One of the observed threat clusters using DARKSIDE leveraged a zero-day vulnerability impacting SonicWall VPN devices to obtain access to victim networks. DARKSIDE victim organizations have been primarily based in the United States and span across multiple sectors, including financial services, legal, manufacturing, professional services, retail, and technology.

" FireEye Intelligence assesses with high confidence that cyber espionage actors pose a serious threat to law firms. Cyber espionage actors, particularly those with a nexus to China, are likely to target law firms to exploit trusted client relationships and gain access to intellectual property or proprietary information to benefit a government sponsor. We assess with high confidence that financially motivated cyber crime poses an ongoing and serious threat to law firms. Financially motivated cyber criminals target legal firms to gain access to client data such as financial and account information, proprietary information, or other sensitive business data. FireEye Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that hacktivists constitute a low threat to law firms. Hacktivists may target law firms to call attention to a cause, but they typically possess limited technical capabilities. Cyber threats to legal services come in various forms including phishing, data breaches, ransomware, supply chain compromise, and insider threats. Moreover, lack of security training and usage of obsolete technology and mobile devices increase the security risk to the law firms.

We anticipate that Russian actors will target the Olympics and elections in 2020; we warn that the potential for Iranian actors to conduct disruptive or destructive attacks is elevated; we expect the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to continue to drive Chinese state-sponsored activities; North Korean groups will likely continue to target financial institutions globally. We assess with high confidence that financially motivated actors continue to innovate and develop new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including the use of ransomware delivered post-compromise. We expect the practice of stealing data prior to deploying ransomware will become more widespread. We assess with moderate confidence that third-party and supply-chain compromises are being leveraged with increasing frequency by both financially motivated and state-sponsored actors.

FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has observed more than 40 advanced threat actors that have conducted operations against telecommunications companies throughout Asia, Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Australia. Financially motivated cyber crime poses a high threat to telecommunications companies and their customers. Telecommunications companies are less frequently directly targeted by these actors, but often collaborate extensively with customers and law enforcement to mitigate criminal threats. Hacktivists constitute a moderate threat to the telecommunications sector. Motivations to target the sector include support of net neutrality, retaliation for perceived injustices, and promotion of nationalist themes. The sector must also consider its position as a key node in the overall critical infrastructure of most countries.

" We assess with high confidence that Russian and Chinese espionage actors consistently pose a high-frequency, high-impact threat to U.S. entities. Future targets are likely to include entities connected to the upcoming U.S. election and entities involved in defense, diplomacy, and/or policymaking. Iran and North Korea also pose a potentially destructive threat based on current geopolitical tensions and past activity. Information operations that support Russian or Iranian interests pose a high-frequency, moderate-impact threat. We have also observed campaigns targeting the U.S. that do not appear to support state interests and at least one campaign that may have been orchestrated by a marketing firm in support of a third party that appeared to support state interests.

Operations range from low to high impact. We assess with moderate confidence that the perceived lucrative nature of high-impact operations, such as targeted ransomware infections, may cause additional actors to adopt these tactics. We assess with moderate confidence that hacktivist groups will continue choosing U.S. targets for demonstrative cyber activity; however, most activity will not constitute a threat to security-conscious and well-resourced entities. We assess with moderate confidence that an increasing number of countries will demonstrate offensive cyber capabilities in the coming years.

Although we identified several notable cyber espionage actors targeting the hospitality sector, the threat from these groups is significantly lower than that from financially motivated actors. We assess with moderate confidence that cyber espionage actors overall pose an occasional and limited-magnitude threat to the hospitality sector. Cyber espionage actors primarily target hospitality businesses to harvest information on targeted guests, almost certainly to enable additional intelligence collection.

" France has been repeatedly targeted by nation-state espionage groups, especially groups from China and Russia. Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that intellectual property theft is a significant driver of espionage activity and is likely to continue based on past targeting and the value of French intellectual property, especially in the transportation, aerospace, and defense sectors. Based on France's influential role in major global institutions such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union (EU), and the United Nations (UN), we assess with high confidence that information operations constitute a moderate threat to France and will continue. We assess with high confidence that France will likely remain a target of financially motivated cyber threat activity for the foreseeable future given the country's relatively high level of wealth and widespread use of technology. Targeted intrusions generally deliver the most damage per incident, but French institutions and individuals are most frequently threatened by common widely distributed malware for account takeover operations.

" The cyber espionage threat to the hospitality industry is uneven, with moderate risk in many locations, but very high risk throughout Europe and many major cities worldwide. Nation-state actors are increasingly targeting the sector to infect high-profile customers, supplementing long-standing risks to corporate information and, in one case, conducting a destructive attack. Hospitality companies face a very high level of cyber crime; it is the most common cyber risk to the industry. Advanced criminal groups consistently target the sector with point of sale (POS) and backdoor malware likely due to the vast amounts of consumer financial data vulnerable to theft in the industry. Extortive attacks have also been observed. Hacktivism poses a minor threat to organizations in the hospitality industry. Targeting is mostly opportunistic and connected to broader themes. Hospitality industry companies are a source and victim of supply chain and third-party attacks. Hospitality companies should adopt robust controls and use available intelligence to mitigate supply chain threats and avoid being the abused third party themselves. In isolated cases, critical infrastructure reliance can affect hospitality industry risk, such as when hazardous sewage was released on the property of an Australian hotel after an ICS insider attack.

" Physical malware attacks on ATMs have historically been (and will likely remain) popular due to the relative ease and low-technical sophistication required for some of these types of operations. However, well-resourced criminal organizations are pursuing network-based malware attacks that rely on expertise in social engineering, network infiltration, and the ability to bypass the security protocols at financial institutions in order to conduct more lucrative cashout or data theft operations. Within the past year, we have seen several ATM malware variants being sold in underground communities at increasingly lower prices, making them more readily available to less resourced actors. The decreasing prices for malware may also reflect the limited success of ATM malware attacks as the implementation of ATM security measures have become more widespread. Actors have often focused their ATM targeting operations on devices deployed with limited physical security countermeasures as well as those employing software subject to known vulnerabilities. Notable ATM exploitation operations have occurred in Europe, Latin America, the U.S., Thailand, Bangladesh, and India in recent years. General strategies that can be used to mitigate common attacks against ATMs include limiting customers' physical access to ATMs, using tamper alarms on high-risk machines, implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) for ATM technicians, network segmentation, continuous network monitoring, and updating ATMs with the latest operating systems (OS) and firmware.

" During several recent incident response engagements, FireEye Mandiant investigators uncovered new tools in FIN7's malware arsenal and kept pace as the global criminal operators attempted new evasion techniques. The first of FIN7's new tools is BOOSTWRITE, an in-memory-only dropper that decrypts embedded payloads using an encryption key retrieved from a remote server at runtime. One of the analyzed BOOSTWRITE variants contained two payloads: CARBANAK and RDFSNIFFER. RDFSNIFFER appears to have been developed to tamper with the NCR Corporation ""Aloha Command Center"" client. While these incidents also included FIN7's typical and long-used toolsets, such as CARBANAK and BABYMETAL, the introduction of new tools and techniques provides further evidence FIN7 is continuing to evolve in response to security enhancements.

" In 2017, Mandiant responded to multiple incidents that we attribute to FIN7, a financially motivated threat group associated with malicious operations dating back to 2015. Mandiant identified that the group leveraged an application shim database to achieve persistence on systems in multiple environments. The shim injected a malicious in-memory patch into the Services Control Manager (""services.exe"") process, and then spawned a CARBANAK backdoor process. Mandiant identified that FIN7 also used this technique to install a payment card harvesting utility for persistent access. This was a departure from FIN7's previous approach of installing a malicious Windows service for process injection and persistent access. ",['Malware Propagation and Deployment'],FIN7

" Based on public reporting , LOCKBIT first emerged in late 2019. LOCKBIT is a Windows ransomware family capable of encrypting files using an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-based multi-threaded encryption algorithm. The key and the infection vector (IV) are then encrypted using the Curve25519 algorithm with an embedded public key and a private key generated at runtime. The malware is capable of maintaining persistence, spreading over the network via group policy objects (GPOs), SMB, and RPC, bypassing UAC, and spamming networked printers with ransom notes. The malware performs a system language check and does not execute on systems using languages common to Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. To facilitate encryption and prevent data recovery, LOCKBIT deletes Volume Shadow Copies and terminates a list of processes and services. After encryption, LOCKBIT creates ransom notes with a .txt extension directing the victim to both a clear web payment domain and a .onion payment website. LOCKBIT has been marketed as part of a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) in underground forums by the Russian-speaking actor ""LockBit"" since Jan. 17, 2020. Mandiant has identified multiple Russian- and English-speaking actors who may currently, or may have previously, been LOCKBIT affiliates. We have observed two variants of LOCKBIT ransomware: LOCKBIT and LOCKBIT 2.0 . LOCKBIT 2.0, which was first announced in late June 2021, is an updated version of LOCKBIT 1.0 that implements broader functionality, including the ability to create and push GPOs to spread the ransomware to other devices in the victim network. Mandiant tracks multiple threat clusters that have deployed LOCKBIT that have demonstrated varying levels of technical sophistication throughout observed intrusions. Similar to other ransomware operations, affiliates deploying LOCKBIT typically use commercially available and legitimate tools to facilitate the various stages of their operations while leveraging custom tools and malware more sparingly. In observed LOCKBIT intrusions, threat actors have generally relied on external remote services and the exploitation of known vulnerabilities rather than phishing campaigns to gain access to victim environments. Like many other ransomware actors, the LOCKBIT affiliates conduct multifaceted extortion they exfiltrate victim data, deploy LOCKBIT ransomware, and threaten to publish the stolen data as a mechanism for pressuring victims into paying the ransom. In September 2020, LockBit advertised the launch of a ransomware shaming blog, and in late June 2021, the RaaS operators launched the LOCKBIT 2.0 shaming site. Prior to launch of the LOCKBIT shaming site in September 2020, individual affiliates were observed threatening to publish or sell company data related to suspected LOCKBIT incidents on the LOCKBIT advertisement thread and in various underground forums.

Several of these cyberattacks were coupled with concurrent information operations, including manipulation of a TV broadcast and dissemination of a deepfake video impersonating the Ukrainian president falsely announcing Ukraine's surrender. Mandiant suggests that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused some temporary disruption to the Russian-speaking cyber crime ecosystem, such as causing ideological divisions within threat groups and inspiring actors to use cyber capabilities in support of Russia or Ukraine. Mandiant observed numerous hacktivists claim to conduct threat activity in support of Russia or Ukraine.

Organizations making statements condemning Russian aggression and/or supporting Ukraine and organizations taking actions to restrict Russian participation in international commerce, competitions, and events face elevated risk of future reprisal. We assess that Sandworm and UNC2589 are two of the most likely actors to conduct cyber attacks in retaliation, although we judge that all high-profile Russian threat actors will continue or increase cyber espionage to enhance decision advantage against Ukrainian and NATO government targets.

These campaigns will likely support a variety of interests, most notably those linked to Russia, China, and Iran. We assess with moderate confidence that disruptive and/or destructive activity, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or ransomware, will impact government and election-related organizations and infrastructure. While media reporting often discusses the potential for compromises of voting machines and related infrastructure to alter vote counts, we assess with moderate confidence that these types of compromises will remain very unlikely but still require vigilance by related stakeholders due to the high impact that even semi-credible accusations of such a compromise would probably have on society and the perceived legitimacy of the election.

" Mandiant Threat Intelligence suggests that the expedient implementation of emergency preparedness measures generates compounding benefits for organizations beyond the immediate goal of improving defenses against an imminent threat. In early 2020, Iranian general Qasem Soleimani's death in a U.S. airstrike led Mandiant to advise organizations to prepare for potential retaliatory Iranian cyber threat activity. Specifically, we suggested prioritizing detection of the initial stages of intrusions and implementing mitigations against commonly observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) Iranian espionage actors employ. Although we have not observed a dramatic increase in the frequency of Iranian operations or significant destructive operations targeting the U.S. or its allies as of July 2021, we suggest that organizations that implemented recommended countermeasures are not only better prepared to defend against potential Iranian activity, but they are also better prepared to counter threat activity from numerous additional threat actors who employ the same or similar TTPs. We expect that these TTPs will remain popular among diverse threat actors for at least the near to mid-term due to their proven effectiveness.

" Key drivers of threat activity in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, a diverse and expansive region that includes more than half of the global population, include regional conflicts and territorial disputes, the increasing volume of ransomware, and the perceived wealth and prosperity of parts of the region. Cyber espionage activity varies based on which sub-region of APAC it occurs in, with Russia being a common threat source in Central Asia, and China being a primary source throughout the region. North Korean activity is also common across most of the region, and we also regularly observe activity by Vietnamese actors and some activity by Indian, Pakistani, and Iranian groups. The APAC region is heavily affected by financially motivated cyber crime. The specific volumes vary by location and likely by perceived wealth, with more developed and technologically integrated countries being more popular targets. While Chinese-language actors are common in the region, we regularly observe a diverse range of international actors being active as well. Information operations are a growing threat within the region, with pro-China campaigns being the most prevalent; however, we do also observe occasional pro-Russia operations, particularly in Central Asia, and apparent Middle Eastern campaigns targeting Centra, South, and Southeast Asia.

Several of these cyberattacks were coupled with concurrent information operations, including manipulation of a TV broadcast and dissemination of a deepfake video impersonating the Ukrainian president falsely announcing Ukraine's surrender. Mandiant suggests that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused some temporary disruption to the Russian-speaking cyber crime ecosystem, such as causing ideological divisions within threat groups and inspiring actors to use cyber capabilities in support of Russia or Ukraine. Mandiant observed numerous hacktivists claim to conduct threat activity in support of Russia or Ukraine.

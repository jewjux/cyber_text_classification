" Given the continued escalations in geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, Mandiant Threat Intelligence recommends critical infrastructure operators remain vigilant in monitoring for malicious activity within their systems and networks. This report summarizes Russia-nexus threat groups that have historically targeted critical infrastructure and contains links to related reporting and activity for critical infrastructure operators to review.

" This is the first in a series of reports examining the opportunities and security challenges of four disruptive information technology (IT) innovations that impact operational technology (OT) environments. This report focuses on machine learning. Machine learning provides organizations with a way to quickly process data from multiple sources to determine the future demands of consumers and internal assets, allowing entities to optimize management operations and resource allocation. Weaknesses inherent to machine learning techniques pose a risk to industrial control systems (ICS) leveraging the technology, which could result in physical damage and financial loss.

" By the end of 2021, Mandiant identified more zero-days exploited in the wild than double the previous record volume in 2019. Led by Chinese groups, state-sponsored groups continue to be the primary actors exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. The proportion of financially motivated actors, particularly ransomware groups, deploying zero-day exploits has been steadily increasing since 2013. Threat actors exploited zero-days in Microsoft, Apple, and Google products most frequently, likely reflecting the popularity of these vendors. The vast increase in zero-day exploitation in 2021, as well as the diversification of actors using them, expands the risk portfolio for organizations in nearly every industry sector and geography, particularly those that rely on these popular systems.

" On July 13, 2019, an alleged hacktivist called 0V1ru$ ( @0v1ruS ) claimed to have compromised Russian company SyTech, a suspected Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) contractor, sharing purportedly stolen data online. We assess with moderate confidence that the leaked materials are legitimate. We suggest that the leaked documents provide valuable insight into Russian government signals intelligence (SIGINT) and cyber espionage capabilities as well as the extent of integration between government organizations and private contractors. The projects described suggest well-resourced efforts to collect intelligence and perform reconnaissance for future cyber espionage and information operations. Cyber espionage actors believed to be associated with the FSB and potentially supported by these programs include APT29, Turla, and TEMP.Isotope.
